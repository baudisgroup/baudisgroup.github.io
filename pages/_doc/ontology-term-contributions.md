## {{ page.title }}

The group is an active contributor to several public ontologies, both through mapping efforts
([ICDOntologies](https://github.com/progenetix/ICDOntologies), [icdot2uberon](https://github.com/progenetix/icdot2uberon)) and
by requesting terms relevant for genomic and metadata e.g. for [EFO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/efo).
