The "BIO390" lecture series at the University of Zurich runs through the Autumn semester,
with once per week 2h lectures, in each ow which a different aspect of bioinformatics is
being presented by a specialist in the respective field. Please visit the

#### Summary

The handling and analysis of biological data using computational methods has become an essential part in most areas of biology. In this lecture, students will be introduced to the use of bioinformatics tools and methods in different topics, such as molecular resources and databases, standards and ontologies, sequence and high performance genome analysis, biological networks, molecular dynamics, proteomics, evolutionary biology and gene regulation. Additionally, the use of low level tools (e.g. Programming and scripting languages) and specialized applications will be demonstrated. Another topic will be the visualization of quantitative and qualitative biological data and analysis results.
