## {{page.title}} [↗︎](https://compbiozurich.org/UZH-BIO392/)

The "BIO392" block course at the University of Zurich runs through the first weeks of the
Autumn semester. The course's focus is on the practical exploration of software tools and
resources related to the analyses of biological sequences, with a focus on human genomic
and proteomic variants.

#### Summary

One of the fastest growing areas of bioinformatics is in the analysis, warehousing and representation of genomic and protein sequence variants, particularly with view on the use of molecular data in personalised health and biomedical applications in general. This course will engage participants to explore common data formats, online resources and analysis techniques, with a focus on human genome variation data.
