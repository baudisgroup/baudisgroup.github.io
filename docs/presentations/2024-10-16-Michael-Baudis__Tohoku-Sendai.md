Since its foundation in 2013 the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)
has emerged as the main international organization to address the challenges of
data discovery in biomedical genomics. The <i>Beacon</i>i>
standard developed by GA4GH with technical support by the European bioinformatics orgabnization
ELIXIR and many international stakeholders has become a default for implementing
modern concepts of federated data discovery and access.

This presentation will provide an introduction into data federation in biomedical genomics
with emphasis on the use of the Beaconm protocol for genomic data discovery, together
with a general introduction into principles and mechanisms of genomics standards development by GA4GH.
