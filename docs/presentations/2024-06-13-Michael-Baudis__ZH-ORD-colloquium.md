The "Moving ORD practices into cancer care" project explores and tests ORD principles in the context of cancer care, through a combination of engagement with relevant communities at the UZH as well as a technical demonstrator of a cutting edge data discovery technology. The cancer community at UZH is being mobilized through a dedicated workshop and topical meetings, to discuss challenges and opportunities of ORD in the oncology domain. A pilot installation of an established ORD approach (Beacon technology by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health) is being implemented to test the sharing of cancer related -omics and associated data with a specific focus on the specific data access and security aspects presenting here.
