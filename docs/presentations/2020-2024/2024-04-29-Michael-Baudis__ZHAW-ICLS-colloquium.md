The last decades have an enormous amount of data generation in the area of biomedical genomics, driven by a feedback loop of technological developments and increasing recognition of human genomic complexities, in health and disease. While individual projects frequently are tailored towards addressing specific research questions, the approach to many problems especially in rare diseases and cancer genomics requires both curated data collections and the access to data from international repositories and study centers.

Here I will present our oncogenomic data resources and research projects, and how our work on data discovery and exchange standards as part of an international community can improve data accessibility through the support of federated discovery and retrieval protocols.
