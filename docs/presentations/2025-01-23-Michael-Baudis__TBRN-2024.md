The past few decades have highlighted the need for large-scale approaches to data
analysis in both rare disease genetics and cancer genomics due to the vast diversity
of genomic variations. While individual and collaborative studies have advanced
research, addressing the different levels of genomic diversity requires both data
curation and the integration of disparate genomic resources.

In this presentation, I will introduce some concepts and examples of genomic data
repositories and explain how our work on the Progenetix oncogenomics resource
aligns with standards development for the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health,
particularly the GA4GH Beacon API.
