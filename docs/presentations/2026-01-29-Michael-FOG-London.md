* The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health - GA4GH - promotes progress in genomic research and human health through a framework of standards for effective and responsible sharing of genomic and related health data 
* The GA4GH Beacon protocol is a key element in these efforts by enabling the search of genomic variants and associated information across international, distributed resources while leaving full control with the resource providers 
* The presentation will introduce the Beacon protocol, its current status, place in the GA4GH ecosystem as well as planned developments and implementations 
* The Beacon protocol’s data discovery and especially sharing abilities will be demonstrated through its use in the Progenetix resource, a reference database for copy number variations (CNV) in cancer

Michael Baudis is a Professor of Bioinformatics at the Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, and a group leader at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Michael studied Medicine in  Heidelberg and did his doctoral studies in molecular cytogenetics at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and the Medical Faculty of the Ruprecht-Karls Universität Heidelberg. Over the course of his research at Stanford University, UF, RWTH Aachen and Zürich University Michael developed a deep interest in large scale analysis data from oncogenomic screening analyses, especial copy number variation data, and principles of open research and provides with the Progenetix resource (progenetix.org) the largest public, curated database for cancer CNV profiling data. 

Since its founding in 2014, Michael has been a member of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) with several leadership roles. He is currently a member of the GA4GH Strategic Leadership Committee and co-leads the GA4GH Beacon protocol development and ELIXIR Beacon Network project, aimed at enabling the search of genomic variants and associated information across international, distributed resources.
