**Abstract**: Accurate determination of the genomic copy number baseline is crucial for identifying copy number alterations (CNAs) in cancer, yet it remains a significant challenge in tumors with complex karyotypes. To address this, we present CNAdjust, an integrated method to systematically detect and correct baseline inaccuracies in CNA data. CNAdjust employs a Bayesian framework that integrates cohort-specific CNA frequency priors with a data-driven plausibility score, ensuring that adjusted calls align with both biological cohort patterns and study-specific data. <!--more--> Performance validation using the TCGA pan-cancer dataset demonstrated improved alignment with absolute copy number estimates and enhanced CNA pattern interpretation. Furthermore, we revealed a strong correlation between chromosomal aneuploidy and baseline abnormalities, underscoring the prevalence of this issue in cancer genomics. By systematically improving the precision of CNA calls, CNAdjust serves as a critical tool for constructing harmonized reference datasets and advancing the progress of precision oncology. Its implementation as a standard, portable workflow enables the reproducible and scalable analysis of large, heterogeneous datasets,
supporting large-scale genomic research. Source codes are available at: [github.com/baudisgroup/CNAdjust](https://github.com/baudisgroup/CNAdjust).
