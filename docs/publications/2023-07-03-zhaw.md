**Motivation**: With the proliferation of research means and computational methodologies, published biomedical literature
is growing exponentially in numbers and volume (Lubowitz et al., 2021). As a consequence, in the fields of biological,
medical and clinical research, domain experts have to sift through massive amounts of scientific text to find relevant
information. However, this process is extremely tedious and slow to be performed by humans. Hence, novel computational
information extraction and correlation mechanisms are required to boost meaningful knowledge extraction. Results: In
this work, we present the design, implementation and application of a novel data extraction and exploration system. This
system extracts deep semantic relations between textual entities from scientific literature to enrich existing structured
clinical data in the domain of cancer cell lines. We introduce a new public data exploration portal, which enables automatic
linking of genomic copy number variants plots with ranked, related entities such as affected genes. Each relation is
accompanied by literature-derived evidences, allowing for deep, yet rapid, literature search, using existing structured
data as a springboard.

**Availability and Implementation**: Our system is publicly available on the web at <https://cancercelllines.org>.
