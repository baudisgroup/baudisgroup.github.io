Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder which predominantly affects men. In a large retrospective survey of the European MCL Network including 304 patients, median age was 63 years at first diagnosis with a male preponderance of 76%.1 The genetic hallmark of MCL is the translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) which leads to overexpression of the CCND1 gene encoding Cyclin D1. Although recent studies revealed a number of genomic alterations and differentially expressed genes in MCL, the causes for the male predominance are still unknown. Hormonal differences might contribute to this gender imbalance.<!--more--> Another hypothesis is that male predominance in MCL results from a sex chromosome linked genetic or epigenetic alteration. Interestingly, some cytogenetic studies on MCL reported recurrent loss of the whole chromosome Y.

Using the karyotype parsing software from the Progenetix project [www.progenetix.org] on data from the Mitelman database [available form URL: http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman, October 2007 edition], we show that 42 out of 365 (11.5%) cytogenetically analyzed t(11;14)-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (B-NHL) in male patients (excluding plasmocytoma/ multiple myeloma, NHL not otherwise specified and immature NHL) harbor a deletion of the Y chomosome.
