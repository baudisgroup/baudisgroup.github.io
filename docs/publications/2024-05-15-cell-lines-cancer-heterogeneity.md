**Abstract**: Cancer cell lines are frequently used in biological and transla-
tional research to study cellular mechanisms and explore treat-
ment options. However, cancer cell lines may display mutational
profiles divergent from native cancers or may be misidentified
or contaminated. We explored how similar cancer cell lines are
to native cancers to find the most suitable representations for
the corresponding diseases by utilising large collections of copy
number variation (CNV) profiles and applied machine learning
(ML) algorithms to predict cell line classifications.<!--more-->


Our results confirm that cancer cell lines indeed accumulate
more mutations compared to native cancers but retain similar
CNV profiles. We demonstrate that many relevant oncogenes
and tumor suppressor genes are altered by CNV events in both
cancers and their corresponding cell lines. Based on the simi-
larities between the two groups and the predictions of the ML
model, we provide some recommendations about cell lines with
good potential to represent selected cancer types in in vitro stud-
ies.
