Specific projects explore computational methods, genomics of selected tumour entities and genomic variant patterns across malignancies. As members of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, the group is developing standards in biocuration and data sharing for genomic variants and phenotypic data, for instance in driving development of the ELIXIR Beacon project. Other research is related to genome data epistemology, e.g. geographic and diagnostic sampling biases in cancer studies.

Between 1994 - 1998, he performed his research thesis in Molecular Cytogenetics in the group of Peter Lichter at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg, on the genomic analysis of malignant lymphomas, in the context of a multi-center clinical trial. He received his doctorate of the Medical Faculty of the Ruprecht-Karls Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg in 1999. </p> <p> While working as physician in Hematology &amp; Oncology at Heidelberg University Hospital, Dr. Baudis continued his research on the molecular cytogenetics and biology of hematologic neoplasias. In January 2001, he began a postdoctoral research project at Stanford University, in the group of Prof. Michael Cleary (Department of Pathology) with focus on the functional characterisation of E2A-HLF and E2A-PBX1 fusion genes in acute lymphoblastic leukemias, using in vitro cell line models with, array based gene expression analysis as well as murine essays. This work was extended during the following position as assistant professor at the University of Florida, starting in late 2003. </p> <p> During his thesis at the DKFZ, Michael became interested in the systematic collection of genome screening data, then from the CGH experiments performed at the Lichter lab. Supported by the University of Heidelberg's Medical School, he extended those early efforts to the systematic collection of original and publication derived genomic copy number data from malignant lymphomas. The website of the progenetix.net molecular cancer cytogenetics website was launched in early 2001, accompanied by a publication in Bioinformatics. </p> <p> After the position at UF and a brief stay at the RWTH Aachen (Human Genetics; 2006-2007), since August 2007 Michael has been a group leader and Professor of Bionformatics (2015) at the Department of Molecular Life Sciences of the University of Z\u00fcrich, as well as associated with the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics SIB. </p> <p> The work of his Computational Oncogenomics group is centered on the comparative analysis of genomic profiling data in cancer, with a focus on somatic copy number variations (CNV, CNA). With the Progenetix repository, the group provides one of the largest reference resources of curated genomic profiling and associated metadata covering the majority of cancer types. </p> <p> Apart from the analysis of cancer genome data, in recent years Michael has worked to facilitate the access to genomic data for research on a global scale. Since its founding in 2014, Michael has been a member of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health GA4GH, currently serving in the steering committee and as co-lead of its \"Discovery\" workstream and - since 2024 - as member of the GA4GH Strategic Leadership Committee. Related to the work in the Global Alliance, Michael also co-chairs the ELIXIR Beacon project, which develops APIs to query genomic data collections in a privacy-protecting manner. Here, the main focus on the group is in prototyping protocol extensions with demonstrator implementation in the Beacon+ project, connected to the Progenetix repository. </p> <p> In the Swiss context, Michael has been involved in advising the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) initiative and lead its \"Bioinformatics and Data Analytics\" working group. </p>"},{"location":"group/More-Alumni/","title":"More Alumni...","text":"<ul> <li>Martin Daellenbach</li> <li>Linda Grob, MSc (ETHZ)</li> <li>Alessio Milanese</li> <li>Nitin Kumar, PhD Cancer Biology LSZGS</li> <li>Haoyang Cai, PhD Cancer Biology LSZGS</li> <li>Kamal Kishore, MSc (UZH)</li> <li>Davide Polizzi</li> <li>Prisni Rath</li> </ul>"},{"location":"group/Ni-Ai/","title":"Ni Ai","text":"Contact Address Ni AiInstitute of Molecular Life SciencesUniversity of ZurichWinterthurerstrasse 190CH-8057 ZurichSwitzerland ORCID email github web Personal Date of birth Nationality email Education 2012 \u2013 current Research thesis in theoretical cancer genomics, Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Switzerland Employment"},{"location":"group/Paula-Carrio-Cordo/","title":"Paula Carrio Cordo","text":"Contact Address Paula Carrio CordoInstitute of Molecular Life SciencesUniversity of ZurichWinterthurerstrasse 190CH-8057 ZurichSwitzerland ORCID email paula.carriocordo@uzh.ch github @paulacarrio Personal Date of birth 30.07.1992 Nationality Spanish Education 2021-04-21 PhD in Molecular Life Sciences of the Faculty of Sciences, University of Zurich 2017 \u2013 2021 Research thesis in theoretical cancer genomics, Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Switzerland 2016 \u2013 2017 Master of Science in Quantitative Biology and Systems Biology, University of Zurich, Switzerland 2013 \u2013 2014 Erasmus exchange - Bachelor of Science in Biology, University of Zurich, Switzerland 2010 \u2013 2015 Bachelor of Science in Biology, University of Oviedo, Spain Employment 08/2017 \u2013 current PhD candidate in Life Science Zurich Graduate School, University of Zurich, Switzerland 07/2017 \u2013 08/2017 Bioinformatician at European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI Hinxton), United Kingdom 06/2015 \u2013 09/2015 Research assistant at National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRA Dijon), France 06/2014 \u2013 09/2014 Research assistant at Department of Evolutionary Biology, University of Zurich, Switzerland"},{"location":"group/Qingyao-Huang/","title":"Qingyao Huang","text":"Contact Address Qingyao HuangInstitute of Molecular Life SciencesUniversity of ZurichWinterthurerstrasse 190CH-8057 ZurichSwitzerland ORCID 0000-0002-8255-4722 email qingyao.huang@uzh.ch github @qingyao Personal Nationality P.R.

However, as these models transition from analyzing population-scale germline data to the more complex landscape of tumor genomes, two critical concerns emerge: whether their learned representations can maintain accuracy across diverse sequencing technologies, and whether clinicians can develop sufficient trust in the latent patterns driving the model predictions.</p> <p>Our ongoing research addresses these challenges through a transfer learning approach, adapting existing genomic language models using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from the ICGC Pan-Cancer cohort. Instead of using pre-processed variant calls, we train models directly on raw sequencing data containing both somatic and germline variations, forcing the architecture to develop its own representations of complex genomic alterations, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs), structural rearrangements (SVs), large-scale insertions/deletions (indels), and copy-number variations (CNVs). </p> <p>To validate our approach, we focus on two key aspects: first, evaluating model generalization by testing fine-tuned versions across multiple independent WGS cancer cohorts with varying technical characteristics; and second, implementing explainability techniques that combine attention mechanisms with feature occlusion tests to identify which genomic segments most influence tumor classification predictions. These model-derived insights are then compared against established driver-gene databases and clinical annotations to assess biological plausibility and clinical relevance.</p> <p>Clinical translation of genomic AI requires both robust multi-dataset validation and biologically interpretable predictions to realize its potential for analyzing complex sequencing data. By addressing these challenges, we aim to bridge the gap between computational innovation and clinically practical insights, paving the way for more trustworthy and generalizable AI applications in precision oncology.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2025-07-09-Beacon-day-at-McGill/","title":"Beacon - History, Future, Implementations","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2025-07-09-Beacon-day-at-McGill/#workshop-summary","title":"Workshop Summary","text":"<p>This workshop explores genomic resources from the Canadian context and how current and future versions of the Beacon  standard can be utilized for data discovery and exchange.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2025-07-09-Beacon-day-at-McGill/#attendees","title":"Attendees","text":"<ul> <li>Michael Baudis (University of Zurich)</li> <li>David Bujold (McGill)</li> <li>David Morais (HSJ)</li> <li>Karen Cranston (UHN)</li> <li>Francis Nguyen (UHN)</li> <li>Sanjeev Lakhwani (McGill)</li> <li>JB Poline (McGill)</li> <li>Sebastian Urchs (McGill)</li> <li>Victor Rochelau (McGill)</li> <li>Justin Richardsson (OICR)</li> <li>Yann Joly (McGill)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"presentations/2025-09-19-Michael-CBB-MSc-presentation/","title":"Theoretical Cytogenetics and Oncogenomics","text":"<p>The presentation at the ETH Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering D-BSSE in Basel introduced the baudisgroup's projects to incoming students of the Computational Biology und Bioinformatics MSc program.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2025-10-07-Michael-GA4GH-poster/","title":"Implementing the GA4GH Beacon API for Genomic Discovery and Sharing in an Open Data Paradigm","text":"<p>Abstract Besides the discovery of genomic and pheno-clinic data in different access settings, the GA4GH Beacon protocol also enables the retrieval of matched records through a variety of open or protected mechanisms, depending on the resources\u2019 data structure as well as data protection and regulatory requirements.

Such a data repository could be valuable in identifying genetic aberration patterns with linkage to specific disease entities, and provide additional information for validating data from large scale expression array experiments.</p> <p>A case and band specific aberration matrix was selected as most suitable format for the mining of CGH data. The [progenetix.net] data repository was developed to provide the according data to the research community for a growing number of human malignancies.</p> <p>In the current implementation, two main purposes are being served. First, access to the band specific pattern of chromosomal imbalances allows the instantaneous identification of genomic \u201chotspots\u201d. Second, the band specific aberration matrices can be included in data mining efforts. As an example, the clustering off all informative cases from the current (September 2001) dataset is shown here (online source under www.progenetix.net/bcats/clustered.png).</p> <p>Data selection PubMed is searched for publications applying CGH to the analysis of malignant tumors. Articles are selected according to their online availability and the description of genomic imbalances on a per case basis.</p> <p>Transformation of input data Chromosomal aberration data is transformed via customized parsing commands to a common format adherent to ISCN 1995 recommendations. In some cases, aberration data was transcribed from graphical representations or provided by the authors.</p> <p>Data storage Currently, the primary data is stored in a dedicated \u201coff-line\u201d database. Besides case identifier and ISCN adapted chromosomal imbalance data, tumor classification and source information including the PubMed identifier is recorded. Disease entities are reclassified to ICD-O-3 codes.</p> <p>Text parsing and generation of aberration matrix For the generation of the case and band specific aberration matrix, a dedicated text pattern comparison model was developed using Perl. Briefly, for each chromosomal band, the aberration field of each case is searched for a variety of patterns containing aberration information applying to that band. A matrix with currently 324 band resolution is generated, annotating chromosomal gains with \u201c1\u201d and losses with \u201c\u20131\u201d; localized high- level gains are designated \u201c2\u201c.</p> <p>Website generation For graphical representation of chromosomal imbalances, HTML pages containing different views of the underlying aberration matrices are generated using Perl. Graphics are implemented using HTML syntax. Besides band specific, whole genomic overviews, chromosome specific pages with links to all involved cases are generated for each ICD-O-3 entity as well as for each registered project. Additionally, those representations are available for several subsets combining related data (e.g. all lymphoid neoplasias, breast carcinoma cases).

However, increased utility of GA4GH schemas requires representation of common biological, health specific and technical metadata.</p> <p>The Metadata Task Team (MTT) of the GA4GH Data Working Group (DWG) has been working on defining the part of the schema representation which not primarily addresses primary or derived \u201comics\u201d (e.g. sequences, variants) data. Core principles of schema development have been the restriction of schema complexity, the use of standardised data formats (e.g. ISO time), and the prominent use of ontologies as externally maintained value descriptors.</p> <p>An important benchmark for a given data schema is the successful projection of reference datasets. However, so far the mapping of rich metadata attributes and structures into the GA4GH schema has not been explored for large, real world datasets or reference repositories.</p> <p>As part of an ELIXIR \u201chuman data implementation study\u201d, we have started to implement datasets as schema-compatible resources, and to explore linking these to external reference services for biomedical ontologies. At the core of this project, we are using the arraymap.org reference database for molecular genomic profiling data in cancer, which contains data from oncogenomic copy number analyses and curated metadata. The study has been directed at testing the GA4GH object model, with a focus on metadata, and at using this experience to guide schema development efforts of the GA4GH MTT. </p> <p>Additionally, as part of a parallel ELIXIR study, our GA4GH conform representation arrayMap data tests forward looking developments of genomic \"Beacons\", with focus on structural genome variants, the inclusion of metadata parameters for data queries, and the development of query interfaces and informative Beacon response formats.</p> <p>At the present time, our test implementation represents &gt;55\u2019000 genomic call sets and allows the direct use of variant and metadata queries against a set of database collections implemented in MongoDB. A first API implementation provides responses to Beacon-style queries, e.g. the frequency of a variant for a tumor type specified through an ontology term.</p> <p>Ongoing efforts aim to promote rapid evolution of the GA4GH metadata schema for a variety of data types and proposed use cases, such as geolocation data, metagenomic applications and temporal relations. On the implementation side, next steps include the integration of ontology services for data query and ingestion scenarios, as well as the extension of the demonstrator API for rich metadata query scenarios. An important part of current and future developments will be the use of additional data resources for demonstration projects.</p> <p>Example datasets as well as tools and documentation are made available through the \u201carraymap2ga4gh\u201d project on Github.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2017-09-13-talk-bc2-michael/#highlights","title":"Highlights","text":"<p>This presentation will be aimed at reporting the current status of the GA4GH schema development with focus on the lessons learned from the data implementation studies, as well as the challenges from design and implementation of data concepts centred around modern object based biodata data standards with heavy dependency on ontologies.

While germline CNVs are a majorcontributor to genomic syndromes and inherited diseases, the majority of cancersaccumulate extensive \u201dsomatic\u201d CNV (sCNV or CNA) during the process ofoncogenetic transformation and progression. While specific sCNV have closelybeen associated with tumorigenesis, intriguingly many neoplasias exhibitrecurrent sCNV patterns beyond the involvement of a few cancer driver genes.Currently, CNV profiles of tumor samples are generated using genomicmicro-arrays or high-throughput DNA sequencing. Regardless of the underlyingtechnology, genomic copy number data is derived from the relative assessmentand integration of multiple signals, with the data generation process being proneto contamination from several sources. Estimated copy number values have noabsolute and linear correlation to their corresponding DNA levels, and the extentof deviation differs between sample profiles which poses a great challenge fordata integration and comparison in large scale genome analysis.</p> <p>Results: In this study, we present a novel method named Minimum ErrorCalibration and Normalization of Copy Numbers Analysis (Mecan4CNA). Foreach sCNV profile,Mecan4CNAreduces the noise level, calculates valuesrepresenting the normal DNA copies (baseline) and the change of one copy (leveldistance), and finally normalizes all values. Experiments ofMecan4CNAonsimulated data showed an overall accuracy of 93% and 91% in determining thebaseline and level distance, respectively. Comparison of baseline and level distanceestimation with existing methods and karyotyping data on the NCI-60 tumor cellline produced coherent results. To estimate the method\u2019s impact on downstreamanalyses we performed GISTIC analyses on original andMecan4CNAdata fromthe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) where the normalized data showed prominentimprovements of both sensitivity and specificity in detecting focal regions.</p> <p>Conclusions:  In general,Mecan4CNAprovides an advanced method for CNAdata normalization especially in research involving data of high volume andheterogeneous quality. With its informative output and visualization, it can alsofacilitate analysis of individual CNA profiles.Mecan4CNAis freely available as aPython package and through Github.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2019-09-10-poster-Qingyao/","title":"Cancer cell lines in focus: somatic copy number & germline variation","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2019-09-10-poster-Qingyao/#bc2-2019-basel","title":"BC2 2019, Basel","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2019-09-10-poster-Qingyao/#qingyao-huang","title":"Qingyao Huang","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2019-09-10-poster-Qingyao/#abstract","title":"Abstract","text":"<p>Background: Human cell lines are convenient model systems in cancer research, for validation of proposed molecular mechanisms as well as to evaluate potential therapeutic approaches, e.g. through high- throughput screening of potential anti-tumour compounds against cancer cell line panels.

In addition, manually curated ontology terms based on retrieved metadata are available, as defined by NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) and International Classification of Diseases-Ontology (ICD-O). For germline analysis, we performed genome-wide phasing and imputation to integrate samples from various array platforms.

While point mutations can be pinpointed to a targeted genetic element, copy number variations (CNVs) involve copy number gain or loss of a large DNA segment which often covers hundreds of genetic elements in one event. Although the vast majority of variations are not directly fucntionally cancer promoting, we observe consistency in CNV landscape within the same cancer types and corresponding increase in heterogeneity along with increased distinction in physiology and morphology. This implies that particular CNV may promote cancer type-specific progression. Previously, it was observed that a focal CNV (with length shorter than 3Mb) indicated stronger functional relevance than large-scale CNV. In addition, we observe higher frequency of CNV segment start and end points near known driver genes. Taken together, we designed a statistic that harness properties of collective CNV segments, to delineate the non-random alteration of genes exerted through CNV. Using 9 different cancer types from multiple sources and platforms, we ranked all genes in the genome for their importance based on the CNV data. The same cancer types cluster together by genome-wide significance scores. Known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can be found at the top. We have also compared with GISTIC2.0 using the same data and identified similar regional peaks, but this method can provide significance measure on the gene level. With the confirmatory results on the known tumor promoting genes, this work has a potential to identify novel functional pathways that are exerted through CNV. </p>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-03-29-Michael-Baudis__CNVs%2C-Progenetix%2C-Beacon-and-GA4GH__Kinderspital-Neuroonkologie/","title":"Implementing GA4GH Standards to Drive an Open Oncogenomics Resource","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-03-29-Michael-Baudis__CNVs%2C-Progenetix%2C-Beacon-and-GA4GH__Kinderspital-Neuroonkologie/#michael-baudis","title":"Michael Baudis","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-03-29-Michael-Baudis__CNVs%2C-Progenetix%2C-Beacon-and-GA4GH__Kinderspital-Neuroonkologie/#seminar-neurooncology-childrens-hospital-zurich","title":"Seminar Neurooncology Childrens Hospital Z\u00fcrich","text":"<p>This seminar gives an overview of the history &amp; current state of the Progenetix resource, it's role in Beacon API development and the overall connection to the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH).</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-04-20-Michael-Baudis__ELIXIR-Beacon__RDA/","title":"Progenetix, Beacon and GA4GH at RDA","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-04-20-Michael-Baudis__ELIXIR-Beacon__RDA/#concepts-status-history-outlook","title":"Concepts | Status | History | Outlook","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-04-20-Michael-Baudis__ELIXIR-Beacon__RDA/#michael-baudis","title":"Michael Baudis","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-04-20-Michael-Baudis__ELIXIR-Beacon__RDA/#research-data-alliance-rda-virtual-plenary-17","title":"Research Data Alliance - RDA Virtual Plenary 17","text":"<p>This seminar gives an overview of current state of the Progenetix Beacon project and the overall connection to the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH).</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-06-08-Michael-Baudis__hCNV-Progenetix-Beacon__ELIXIR-All-Hands/","title":"hCNV data and the Progenetix Beacon","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-06-08-Michael-Baudis__hCNV-Progenetix-Beacon__ELIXIR-All-Hands/#michael-baudis","title":"Michael Baudis","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-06-08-Michael-Baudis__hCNV-Progenetix-Beacon__ELIXIR-All-Hands/#elixir-all-hands-2021","title":"ELIXIR All Hands 2021","text":"<p>This presentation gives a brief overview of the use of the Progenetix resource to test and implement a genomics reference resource using the emerging Beacon v2 protocol.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-06-11-Michael-Baudis__hCNV-implementation-studies__ELIXIR-Human-Data-Day/","title":"hCNV Community and Implementation Studies","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-06-11-Michael-Baudis__hCNV-implementation-studies__ELIXIR-Human-Data-Day/#michael-baudis","title":"Michael Baudis","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-06-11-Michael-Baudis__hCNV-implementation-studies__ELIXIR-Human-Data-Day/#elixir-all-hands-2021-human-data-day","title":"ELIXIR All Hands 2021 Human Data Day","text":"<p>At the Human Data Day Michael presents a very brief overview of the ending and upcoming ELIXIR hCNV implementation studies.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-08-03-Qingyao-Huang__Progenetix-oncogenomic-resource__CGC-talk/","title":"Progenetix - An open reference resource for copy number vatiation data in cancer","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-08-03-Qingyao-Huang__Progenetix-oncogenomic-resource__CGC-talk/#qingyao-huang","title":"Qingyao Huang","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-08-03-Qingyao-Huang__Progenetix-oncogenomic-resource__CGC-talk/#additional-links","title":"Additional Links","text":"<ul> <li>Video Recording of Presentation</li> <li>Slides PDF</li> </ul>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-08-31-Michael-Baudis__Progenetix-GA4GH-standards__ESHG-2021/","title":"Cancer genomics reference resource and toolkit around GA4GH standards","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2024/2021-08-31-Michael-Baudis__Progenetix-GA4GH-standards__ESHG-2021/#q-huang-b-gao-r-paloots-p-carrio-cordo-z-yang-m-baudis","title":"Q.

While specific CNV events and some recurring patterns have contributed to the identification of individual cancer drivers and the recognition of cancer  subtypes, the complexity of genomic CNV patterns requires large amounts of well-defined genomic profiles for statistically meaningful analyses. At the other end of the spectrum, in the area of rare disease genomics the potential pathogenicity of individual CNV events requires validation against a vast set of disease-related and reference genomic profiles and annotations.</p> <p>Methods The \u201cBeacon\u201d protocol - developed with support from ELIXIR, the European bioinformatics infrastructure organization, as a standard of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) - represents an emerging standard for an \u201cInternet for Genomics\u201d. While the initial version of the protocol served as a widely adopted test bed for the sharing of genomic variants over federated query systems connecting hundreds of internationally distributed resources, the version 2 of the protocol aims at providing a framework for extended, metadata-rich query and response options in both public and restricted federated access scenarios. Throughout the development of Beacon v2, the Progenetix cancer genomics resource (progenetix.org) - including the largest publicly accessible set of cancer CNV data - has served as a testbed for implementation of Beacon v2 protocol features. </p> <p>Results With the implementation of the Beacon v2 API as backbone of the Progenetix resource - serving genome-wide CNV profiling data from more than 130\u2019000 individual experiments, representing over 700 diagnostic entities and  more that 1\u2019500 published studies - we could demonstrate the use of the GA4GH Beacon v2 protocol as a practical solution for the sharing of vast amounts of genomic profiling data, in a open setting and using a documented, completely open API for third party use. Conclusion:</p> <p>With the Beacon v2 protocol - as a major upgrade from the v1 standard - currently being under review as GA4GH standard, work is focussing on its implementation in a wide set of use cases, from access protected clinical information systems to public-access research databases. Importantly, an ELIXIR-supported implementation study by members of the ELIXIR h-CNV community (cnvar.org) will explore the generation of Beacon v2 powered CNV implementations by various major European genomics resources, in the fields of human genetics / rare diseases and cancer genomics.</p> <p>References</p> <ul> <li>Huang, Q., Carrio-Cordo, P., Gao, B., Paloots, R., &amp; Baudis, M.

Nuclear poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) formation is thought to be induced in response to oxidative DNA damage and to promote cell death under sustained oxidative stress conditions. However, what exactly triggers PAR induction in response to oxidative stress is incompletely understood. Using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and in-depth analysis of key stress signaling components, we observed that PAR formation induced by H2O2 was mediated by the PLC/IP3R/Ca(2+)/PKC\u03b1 signaling axis. Mechanistically, H2O2-induced PAR formation correlated with Ca(2+)-dependent DNA damage, which, however, was PKC\u03b1-independent. In contrast, PAR formation was completely lost upon knockdown of PKC\u03b1, suggesting that DNA damage alone was not sufficient for inducing PAR formation, but required a PKC\u03b1-dependent process. Intriguingly, the loss of PAR formation observed upon PKC\u03b1 depletion was overcome when the chromatin structure-modifying protein HMGB1 was co-depleted with PKC\u03b1, suggesting that activation and nuclear translocation of PKC\u03b1 releases the inhibitory effect of HMGB1 on PAR formation. Together, these results identify PKC\u03b1 and HMGB1 as important co-regulators involved in H2O2-induced PAR formation, a finding that may have important relevance for oxidative stress-associated pathophysiological conditions.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2016-09-01-PKC%CE%B1-and-HMGB1/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>EPMC</li> <li>PDF</li> </ul>"},{"location":"publications/2016-10-01-CNARA-reliability/","title":"CNARA: reliability assessment for genomic copy number profiles","text":""},{"location":"publications/2016-10-01-CNARA-reliability/#ai-n-cai-h-solovan-c-baudis-m","title":"Ai N, Cai H, Solovan C, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract DNA copy number profiles from microarray and sequencing experiments sometimes contain wave artefacts which may be introduced during sample preparation and cannot be removed completely by existing preprocessing methods. Besides, large derivative log ratio spread (DLRS) of the probes correlating with poor DNA quality is sometimes observed in genome screening experiments and may lead to unreliable copy number profiles. Depending on the extent of these artefacts and the resulting misidentification of copy number alterations/variations (CNA/CNV), it may be desirable to exclude such samples from analyses or to adapt the downstream data analysis strategy accordingly.Here, we propose a method to distinguish reliable genomic copy number profiles from those containing heavy wave artefacts and/or large DLRS. We define four features that adequately summarize the copy number profiles for reliability assessment, and train a classifier on a dataset of 1522 copy number profiles from various microarray platforms. The method can be applied to predict the reliability of copy number profiles irrespective of the underlying microarray platform and may be adapted for those sequencing platforms from which copy number estimates could be computed as a piecewise constant signal. Further details can be found at github.com/baudisgroup/CNARA .We have developed a method for the assessment of genomic copy number profiling data, and suggest to apply the method in addition to and after other state-of-the-art noise correction and quality control procedures. CNARA could be instrumental in improving the assessment of data used for genomic data mining experiments and support the reliable functional attribution of copy number aberrations especially in cancer research.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2017-10-01-Integrated-Molecular/","title":"Integrated Molecular...","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2017-10-01-Integrated-Molecular/#integrated-molecular-meta-analysis-of-1000-pediatric-high-grade-and-diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma","title":"Integrated Molecular Meta-Analysis of 1,000 Pediatric High-Grade and Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma.","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2017-10-01-Integrated-Molecular/#mackay-a-burford-a-carvalho-d-izquierdo-e-fazal-salom-j-taylor-kr-bjerke-l-clarke-m-vinci-m-nandhabalan-m-temelso-s-popov-s-molinari-v-raman-p-waanders-aj-han-hj-gupta-s-marshall-l-zacharoulis-s-vaidya-s-mandeville-hc-bridges-lr-martin-aj-al-sarraj-s-chandler-c-ng-hk-li-x-mu-k-trabelsi-s-brahim-dh-kisljakov-an-konovalov-dm-moore-as-carcaboso-am-sunol-m-de-torres-c-cruz-o-mora-j-shats-li-stavale-jn-bidinotto-lt-reis-rm-entz-werle-n-farrell-m-cryan-j-crimmins-d-caird-j-pears-j-monje-m-debily-ma-castel-d-grill-j-hawkins-c-nikbakht-h-jabado-n-baker-sj-pfister-sm-jones-dtw-fouladi-m-von-bueren-ao-baudis-m-resnick-a-jones-c","title":"Mackay A, Burford A, Carvalho D, Izquierdo E, Fazal-Salom J, Taylor KR, Bjerke L, Clarke M, Vinci M, Nandhabalan M, Temelso S, Popov S, Molinari V, Raman P, Waanders AJ, Han HJ, Gupta S, Marshall L, Zacharoulis S, Vaidya S, Mandeville HC, Bridges LR, Martin AJ, Al-Sarraj S, Chandler C, Ng HK, Li X, Mu K, Trabelsi S, Brahim DH, Kisljakov AN, Konovalov DM, Moore AS, Carcaboso AM, Sunol M, de Torres C, Cruz O, Mora J, Shats LI, Stavale JN, Bidinotto LT, Reis RM, Entz-Werle N, Farrell M, Cryan J, Crimmins D, Caird J, Pears J, Monje M, Debily MA, Castel D, Grill J, Hawkins C, Nikbakht H, Jabado N, Baker SJ, Pfister SM, Jones DTW, Fouladi M, von Bueren AO, Baudis M, Resnick A, Jones C.","text":"<p>Abstract We collated data from 157 unpublished cases of pediatric high-grade glioma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma and 20 publicly available datasets in an integrated analysis of &gt;1,000 cases.

Disentangling the effects related to particular population backgrounds can help in both understanding cancer biology and in tailoring therapeutic interventions.

While tools to map and utilize ancestry information from healthy individuals have been introduced, a population assignment based on genotyping data from somatic variation profiling of cancer samples is still missing. We analyzed sequencing-based variation data from the 1000 Genomes project, containing 2504 individuals out of 5 continental groups.

We found that despite widespread and extensive somatic mutations of cancer profiling data, more than 90% of cancer samples can be correctly mapped to one of the population group when compared to their paired unmutated normals. Pre-filtering samples for admixed individuals increased the accuracy to 96%. This work provides a data-driven approach to estimate the population background from cancer genome profiling data. This proof-of-concept study will facilitate efforts to understand the interplay between population and ethnicity related genetic background and differences in understanding statistical and molecular differences in cancer entities with respect to possible hereditary contributions.

Rapid improvements in molecular profiling techniques, the accumulation of large amount of data in genomic alterations in human malignancies and the expansion of bioinformatic tools and methodologies have facilitated the understanding of the molecular changes during oncogenesis, and their correlation with clinico-pathological phenotypes.

Disentangling the effects related to particular population backgrounds can help in both understanding cancer biology and in tailoring therapeutic interventions. Because self-reported or inferred patient data can be incomplete or misleading due to migration and genomic admixture, a data-driven ancestry estimation should be preferred. While algorithms to analyze ancestry structure from healthy individuals have been developed, an easy-to-use tool to assign population groups based on genotyping data from SNP profiles is still missing and benchmarking for the validity of population assignment strategy for aberrant cancer genomes was not tested. We benchmarked the consistency and accuracy of cross-platform population assignment. We also demonstrated its high accuracy to process unaltered as well as cancer genomes. Despite widespread and extensive somatic mutations of cancer profiling data, population assignment consistency between germline and highly mutated samples from cancer patients reached of 97% and 92% for assignment into 5 and 26 populations respectively. Comparison of our benchmarked results with self- reported meta-data estimated a matching rate between 88 % to 92%.

Whether specific vulnerabilities to PARPi exist beyond BRCA mutations and related defects in homology-directed repair (HDR) is not well understood. Here, we identify the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIP12 as negative regulator of PARPi sensitivity. We show that TRIP12 controls steady-state PARP1 levels and limits PARPi-induced cytotoxic PARP1 trapping. Upon loss of TRIP12, elevated PARPi-induced PARP1 trapping causes increased DNA replication stress, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TRIP12 binds PARP1 via a central PAR-binding WWE domain and, using its carboxy-terminal HECT domain, catalyzes polyubiquitylation of PARP1, triggering proteasomal degradation and preventing supra-physiological PARP1 accumulation. Further, in cohorts of breast and ovarian cancer patients, PARP1 abundance is negatively correlated with TRIP12 expression. We thus propose TRIP12 as regulator of PARP1 stability and PARPi-induced PARP trapping, with potential implications for PARPi sensitivity and resistance.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2020-10-13-The-ELIXIR-Human-Copy-Number-Variations-Community/","title":"The ELIXIR Human Copy Number Variations Community: building bioinformatics infrastructure for research","text":""},{"location":"publications/2020-10-13-The-ELIXIR-Human-Copy-Number-Variations-Community/#salgado-d-armean-im-baudis-m-et-al","title":"Salgado D, Armean IM, Baudis M et al.","text":""},{"location":"publications/2020-10-13-The-ELIXIR-Human-Copy-Number-Variations-Community/#f1000research-2020-9-elixir1229","title":"F1000Research 2020, 9 (ELIXIR):1229","text":"<p>Abstract Copy number variations (CNVs) are major causative contributors both in the genesis of genetic diseases and human neoplasias.

To disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis as well as identify and characterize molecular subtypes, the comparative and meta-analysis of large genomic variant collections can be of immense importance. Over the last decades, cancer genomic profiling projects have resulted in a large amount of somatic genome variation profiles, however segregated in a multitude of individual studies and datasets. The Progenetix project, initiated in 2001, curates individual cancer CNA profiles and associated metadata from published oncogenomic studies and data repositories with the aim to empower integrative analyses spanning all different cancer biologies. During the last few years, the fields of genomics and cancer research have seen significant advancement in terms of molecular genetics technology, disease concepts, data standard harmonization as well as data availability, in an increasingly structured and systematic manner. For the Progenetix resource, continuous data integration, curation and maintenance have resulted in the most comprehensive representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138 663 (including 115 357 tumor) copy number variation (CNV) profiles.

Phenotypic features (signs, symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, results of physiological tests, etc.) are of high clinical importance, yet exchanging them in conjunction with genomic variation information is often overlooked or even neglected. In the clinical domain, substantial work has been dedicated to the development of computational phenotypes. Traditionally, these approaches have largely relied on rule-based methods and large sources of clinical data to identify cohorts of patients with or without a specific disease.

While STR length variations are known to regulate gene expression under physiological conditions, the functional impact of STR mutations in CRC remains unclear. Here, we integrate STR mutation data with clinical information and gene expression levels to study the gene regulatory effects of STR mutations in CRC. We confirm that STR mutability in CRC highly depends on the MSI status, repeat unit size, and repeat length. Furthermore, we present a set of 1244 putative expression STRs (eSTRs) for which the STR length is associated with gene expression levels in CRC tumours. The length of 73 eSTRs is associated with expression levels of cancer-related genes, nine of which are CRC-specific genes. We show that linear models describing eSTR-gene expression relationships allow for predictions of gene expression changes in response to eSTR mutations. Moreover, we found an increased mutability of eSTRs in MSI tumours. Our evidence of gene regulatory roles for eSTRs in CRC highlights a mostly overlooked way through which tumours may modulate their phenotypes. The increased mutability of eSTRs in MSI tumours may be an early indication that eSTR mutations can confer a selective advantage to tumours.

Here, we leverage whole-exome sequencing and gene expression data to identify STRs for which repeat lengths are associated with the expression of nearby genes (eSTRs) in colorectal, stomach, and endometrial tumors. While most eSTRs are cancer-specific, shared eSTRs across multiple cancers exhibit consistent effects on gene expression. Notably, coding-region eSTRs identified in all three cancer types show positive correlations with nearby gene expression. We further validate the functional effects of eSTRs by demonstrating associations between somatic eSTR mutations and gene expression changes during the transition from normal to tumor tissues, suggesting their potential roles in tumorigenesis. Combined with DNA methylation data, we perform the first quantitative analysis of the interplay between STR variations and DNA methylation in tumors.

CNAttention effectively learns CNA features unique to each cancer type and generates CNA signatures for 30 cancer types using attention mechanisms, highlighting the distinctiveness of their CNA landscapes. CNAttention demonstrates high accuracy and exhibits stable performance even with the incorporation of external datasets or parameter adjustments, underscoring its effectiveness in tumor identification. Expanding these signatures to cancer classification trees reveals common patterns not only among physiologically related cancer types but also among clinico-pathologically distant types, such as different cancers originating from neural crest derived cells. Additionally, detected signatures also uncover genomic heterogeneity in individual cancer types, for instance in brain lower grade glioma. Additional experiments with classification models underscore the efficacy of these signatures in representing various cancer types and their potential utility in clinical diagnosis.</p>"},{"location":"publications/1995-2000/1995-12-01-Identification-of/","title":"Identification of genetic imbalances in malignant lymphoma using comparative genomic hybridization","text":""},{"location":"publications/1995-2000/1995-12-01-Identification-of/#bentz-m-dohner-h-werner-ca-huck-k-baudis-m-joos-s-schlegelberger-b-trumper-lh-feller-ac-pfreundschuh-m","title":"Bentz M, D\u00f6hner H, Werner CA, Huck K, Baudis M, Joos S, Schlegelberger B, Tr\u00fcmper LH, Feller AC, Pfreundschuh M.","text":"<p>Abstract In comparison to leukemias, the clinical relevance of chromosomal aberrations in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is not as well understood.

Results of CGH studies in three different types of lymphoproliferative disorders are outlined in this paper demonstrating that: (1) in chronic B cell leukemias, chromosomal aberrations are missed by banding analysis in a high proportion of cases, (2) CGH on paraffin-embedded tissue samples can be used for cytogenetic analysis within clinical multicenter trials and (3) DNA amplifications are more frequent in NHL than previously assumed.

METHODS: In order to further define specific DNA copy number changes in cervical cancer, we analyzed 20 cervical samples (3 pre-malignant lesions, 10 invasive tumors, and 7 cell lines), using the GenoSensor microarray CGH system to define particular genetic targets that suffer copy number changes. RESULTS: The most common DNA gains detected by array CGH in the invasive samples were located at the RBP1-RBP2 (3q21-q22) genes, the sub-telomeric clone C84C11/T3 (5ptel), D5S23 (5p15.2) and the DAB2 gene (5p13) in 58.8% of the samples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published CGH data from 231 primary untreated neuroblastomas were converted to a digitized format suitable for global data mining, subgroup discovery, and multivariate survival analyses. RESULTS: In contrast to previous reports, which included only a few genetic parameters, we present here for the first time a strategy that allows unbiased evaluation of all genetic imbalances detected by CGH. The presented approach firmly established the existence of three different clinicogenetic subgroups and indicated that chromosome 17 status and tumor stage were the only independent significant predictors for patient outcome. Important new findings were: (1) a normal chromosome 17 status as a delineator of a subgroup of presumed favorable-stage tumors with highly increased risk; (2) the recognition of a survivor signature conferring 100% 5-year survival for stage 1, 2, and 4S tumors presenting with whole chromosome 17 gain; and (3) the identification of 3p deletion as a hallmark of older age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: We propose a new regression model for improved patient outcome prediction, incorporating tumor stage, chromosome 17, and amplification/deletion status.

To identify additional loci likely involved in CRC and to test the hypothesis of allele-specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the localization of CRC susceptibility genes, we initially conducted a genome-wide allelotyping analysis of 48 adenomas from a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) and 63 adenomas from 7 patients with sporadic CRC using 79 fluorescently tagged oligonucleotide primers amplifying microsatellite loci covering the human genome. Frequent allelic losses were identified at D17S802 (41%), D7S518 (40%), D18S53 (38%), D10S249 (32%), D2S391 (29%), D16S419 (27%), D15S1005 and D15S120 (24%), D9S274 and D11S1318 (23%), D14S65 (20%), D14S274 and D17S953 (19%), D19S424 (18%), D5S346 and D1S397 (15%), and D6S468 (13%) in multiple FAP adenomas. Common LOH was also detected at D4S1584 (42%), D11S968 (31%), D17S953 (28%), D5S394, D9S286 and D10S249 (24%), D8S511 (23%), D13S158 (21%), D7S669 (20%), D18S58 (19%), D2S162 and D16S432 (16%), D2S206 (15%), D7S496 and D17S946 (14%), D6S292 (13%), D4S1586 and D8S283 (11%), and D1S2766 (10%) in multiple CRC adenomas. In addition, allele-specific LOH at D5S346, D15S1005, and D15S120 was observed in multiple FAP adenomas (P &lt; 0.01) and at D2S206 and D16S423 in multiple CRC (P &lt; 0.05). To compare our data to previous reports, we determined the band-specific frequency of chromosomal imbalances in CRC karyotypes reported in the Mitelman database, and from the CGH results of cases accessible through the PROGENETIX website. Furthermore, published genome-wide allelotyping analysis of CRC and other allele-specific LOH studies were compiled and collated with our LOH data. The combined results not only provide a comprehensive view of genetic losses in CRC, indicating the comparability of these different techniques, but they also reveal different novel loci in multiple adenomas from FAP and sporadic CRC patients, suggesting that they represent a distinct subtype of CRC in terms of allelic losses.

The goal is to develop a systematic way of placing patients with similar CGH imbalance profiles into the same cluster. Our expectation is that patients with the same cancer types will generally belong to the same cluster as their underlying CGH profiles will be similar. RESULTS: We focus on distance-based clustering strategies. We do this in two steps. (1) Distances of all pairs of CGH samples are computed. (2) CGH samples are clustered based on this distance. We develop three pairwise distance/similarity measures, namely raw, cosine and sim. Raw measure disregards correlation between contiguous genomic intervals. It compares the aberrations in each genomic interval separately. The remaining measures assume that consecutive genomic intervals may be correlated. Cosine maps pairs of CGH samples into vectors in a high-dimensional space and measures the angle between them. Sim measures the number of independent common aberrations. We test our distance/similarity measures on three well known clustering algorithms, bottom-up, top-down and k-means with and without centroid shrinking. Our results show that sim consistently performs better than the remaining measures. This indicates that the correlation of neighboring genomic intervals should be considered in the structural analysis of CGH datasets. The combination of sim with top-down clustering emerged as the best approach. AVAILABILITY: All software developed in this article and all the datasets are available from the authors upon request.

PROCEDURE: We used representational difference analysis to identify candidate E2A-HLF target genes. Transient transfection assays and an inducible expression model system were then used to evaluate the ability of E2A-HLF to modulate target gene expression. RESULTS: We identified ABCB1 (MDR1, P-glycoprotein) as a gene differentially expressed in ALL cell lines with and without E2A-HLF expression and demonstrated that t(17;19)+ ALL cell lines expressed high levels of ABCB1 protein and had a drug efflux-positive phenotype. Although ABCB1 transcription is regulated by C/EBPbeta via interaction with a DNA response element that shares significant homology with the optimal E2A-HLF binding site, E2A-HLF did not directly activate transcription of reporter genes under control of ABCB1 promoter elements in transient transfection assays. However, ABCB1 expression was induced in a DNA-binding independent manner by E2A-HLF, E2A-PBX1, and truncated E2A polypeptides consisting of those portions of E2A present in leukemic fusion proteins.

Genomic aberrations occurring in more than five patients were studied for impact on locoregional progression (LRP)-free survival. p values were adjusted by the Hochberg-Benjamini procedure and significant aberrations and clinical variables subjected to a stepwise backwards Cox proportional model.

However, diagnostic dilemmas may arise in daily practice due to overlap of BL with subsets of other aggressive, mature B-cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Recently, two gene expression studies have described a distinct molecular profile for BL, but also showed the persistence of some cases intermediate between BL and DLBCL. An alternative approach to define BL is to consider (cyto)genetic data, in particular chromosomal abnormalities other than the t(8;14) or its variants. In this review the 'Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer,' harboring the majority of all published neoplasia-related karyotypes, was explored to define a cytogenetic profile of 'true' BL. This core subset of BL showed a very low complexity of chromosomal abnormalities with 40% of the cases having the IG-MYC fusion as the sole abnormality. In the remaining cases, additional recurrent but partially exclusive abnormalities included gains at chromosomes 1q, 7 and 12, and losses of 6q, 13q32-34 and 17p. Within the core subset, no differences were found between pediatric and adult patients. In addition, the genetic profile of the core subset was significantly different from BL with an 8q24 breakpoint not affecting one of the three immunoglobulin loci, BL with a translocation involving 18q21/BCL2, 3q27/BCL6 or 11q13/BCL1, additionally to a breakpoint at 8q24/MYC, and from other morphological types of lymphomas with an 8q24/MYC breakpoint. These groups showed a higher cytogenetic complexity than the core subset of BL. BL without a detectable 8q24/MYC breakpoint might be heterogeneous and deserves further studies. We suggest that, concordant with the WHO classification to be published in 2008, the diagnosis of BL should be restricted to cases with expression of CD10 and BCL6, absence or very weak expression of BCL2 protein, a homogeneously very high proliferation index and a proven IG-MYC translocation without evidence of a chromosomal translocation typical for other lymphoma entities.

Here, we report on a patient with Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and a paternally inherited 0.46 Mb duplication in 21q22 affecting the KCNE1 and DSCR1/RCAN genes. The identification of an involvement of KCNE1 was interesting because it encodes the beta-subunit of the KvLQT1 channel as the slow component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K(+) current. Since duplication of the KCNQ1 gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the same channel was reported recently in another SRS patient, we screened both genes for mutations in a cohort of SRS patients without detecting pathologic variants. We presume that the duplication of the two functionally linked genes in different patients with the same disorder is a coincidental finding. However, the lack of DS typical clinical features in our case allows us to further narrow down the DSCR in 21q22. We conclude that DSCR1/RCAN is not sufficient for generating phenotypic features associated with DS but our observation does not contradict a possible role for DSCR1/RCAN in mediating DYRK1A-based effects.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2010-05-01-Submicroscopic/","title":"Submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances in idiopathic Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS): the SRS phenotype overlaps with the 12q14 microdeletion syndrome","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2010-05-01-Submicroscopic/#spengler-s-schonherr-n-binder-g-wollmann-ha-fricke-otto-s-muhlenberg-r-denecke-b-baudis-m-eggermann-t","title":"Spengler S, Sch\u00f6nherr N, Binder G, Wollmann HA, Fricke-Otto S, M\u00fchlenberg R, Denecke B, Baudis M, Eggermann T.","text":"<p>Abstract Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a heterogeneous disorder associated with intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction, body asymmetry, a relative macrocephaly, a characteristic triangular face and further dysmorphisms.

Apart from known apathogenic copy number variations, we identified one patient with a 12q14 microdeletion. The 12q14 microdeletion syndrome is characterised by dwarfism but it additionally includes mental retardation and osteopoikilosis. The deletion in our patient is smaller than those in the 12q14 microdeletion carriers but it also affects the LEMD3 and the HMGA2 genes. LEMD3 haploinsufficiency and point mutations have been previously associated with osteopoikilosis but radiographs of our patient at the age of 16 years did not reveal any hint for osteopoikilosis lesions. Haploinsufficiency of HMGA2 is probably responsible for aberrant growth in 12q14 microdeletion syndrome. However, in this study, a general role of HMGA2 mutations for SRS was excluded by sequencing of 20 idiopathic patients. In conclusion, our results exclude a common cryptic chromosomal imbalance in idiopathic SRS patients but show that chromosomal aberrations are relevant in this disease.

Since more than one CNA can be detected in most tumors, frequently co-occurring genetic CNA may point to cooperating cancer related genes. Existing methods for co-occurrence evaluation so far have not considered the overall heterogeneity of CNA per tumor, resulting in a preferential detection of frequent changes with limited specificity for each association due to the high genetic instability of many samples. METHOD: We hypothesize that in cancer some linkage-independent CNA may display a non-random co-occurrence, and that these CNA could be of pathogenetic relevance for the respective cancer. We also hypothesize that the statistical relevance of co-occurring CNA may depend on the sample specific CNA complexity. We verify our hypotheses with a simulation based algorithm CDCOCA (complexity dependence of co-occurring chromosomal aberrations). RESULTS: Application of CDCOCA to example data sets identified co-occurring CNA from low complex background which otherwise went unnoticed. Identification of cancer associated genes in these co-occurring changes can provide insights of cooperative genes involved in oncogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a method to detect associations of regional copy number abnormalities in cancer data. Along with finding statistically relevant CNA co-occurrences, our algorithm points towards a generally low specificity for co-occurrence of regional imbalances in CNA rich samples, which may have negative impact on pathway modeling approaches relying on frequent CNA events.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2011-07-01-Silver-Russell/","title":"Silver-Russell patients showing a broad range of ICR1 and ICR2 hypomethylation in different tissues","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2011-07-01-Silver-Russell/#begemann-m-spengler-s-kanber-d-haake-a-baudis-m-leisten-i-binder-g-markus-s-rupprecht-t-segerer-h-fricke-otto-s-muhlenberg-r-siebert-r-buiting-k-eggermann-t","title":"Begemann M, Spengler S, Kanber D, Haake A, Baudis M, Leisten I, Binder G, Markus S, Rupprecht T, Segerer H, Fricke-Otto S, M\u00fchlenberg R, Siebert R, Buiting K, Eggermann T.","text":"<p>Abstract In all known congenital imprinting disorders an association with aberrant methylation or mutations at specific loci was well established. However, several patients with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM), Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) exhibiting multilocus hypomethylation (MLH) have meanwhile been described. Whereas TNDM patients with MLH show clinical symptoms different from carriers with isolated 6q24 aberrations, MLH carriers diagnosed as BWS or SRS present only the syndrome-specific features. Interestingly, SRS and BWS patients with nearly identical MLH patterns in leukocytes have been identified. We now report on the molecular findings in DNA in three SRS patients with hypomethylation of both 11p15 imprinted control regions (ICRs) in leukocytes. One patient was a monozygotic (MZ) twin, another was a triplet. While the hypomethylation affected both oppositely imprinted 11p15 ICRs in leukocytes, in buccal swab DNA only the ICR1 hypomethylation was visible in two of our patients. In the non-affected MZ twin of one of these patients, aberrant methylation was also present in leukocytes but neither in buccal swab DNA nor in skin fibroblasts. Despite mutation screening of several factors involved in establishment and maintenance of methylation marks including ZFP57, MBD3, DNMT1 and DNMT3L the molecular clue for the ICR1/ICR2 hypomethylation in our patients remained unclear. Furthermore, the reason for the development of the specific SRS phenotype is not obvious.

Recent approaches to molecularly classify RCC were based on clinical, pathological as well as on single molecular parameters. As a consequence, gene expression patterns reflecting the sum of genetic aberrations in individual tumors may not have been recognized. In an attempt to uncover such molecular features in RCC, we used a novel, unbiased and integrative approach. METHODS: We integrated gene expression data from 97 primary RCC of different pathologic parameters, 15 RCC metastases as well as 34 cancer cell lines for two-way nonsupervised hierarchical clustering using gene groups suggested by the PANTHER Classification System. We depicted the genomic landscape of the resulted tumor groups by means of Single Nuclear Polymorphism (SNP) technology. Finally, the achieved results were immunohistochemically analyzed using a tissue microarray (TMA) composed of 254 RCC. RESULTS: We found robust, genome wide expression signatures, which split RCC into three distinct molecular subgroups. These groups remained stable even if randomly selected gene sets were clustered. Notably, the pattern obtained from RCC cell lines was clearly distinguishable from that of primary tumors. SNP array analysis demonstrated differing frequencies of chromosomal copy number alterations among RCC subgroups. TMA analysis with group-specific markers showed a prognostic significance of the different groups.

Besides specifically targeting well-known, canonical oncogenes, CNAs may also play more subtle roles in terms of modulating genetic potential and broad gene expression patterns of developing tumors. Any significant differences in the overall CNA patterns between different cancer types may thus point towards specific biological mechanisms acting in those cancers. In addition, differences among CNA profiles may prove valuable for cancer classifications beyond existing annotation systems. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have analyzed molecular-cytogenetic data from 25579 tumors samples, which were classified into 160 cancer types according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system. When correcting for differences in the overall CNA frequencies between cancer types, related cancers were often found to cluster together according to similarities in their CNA profiles. Based on a randomization approach, distance measures from the cluster dendrograms were used to identify those specific genomic regions that contributed significantly to this signal. This approach identified 43 non-neutral genomic regions whose propensity for the occurrence of copy number alterations varied with the type of cancer at hand. Only a subset of these identified loci overlapped with previously implied, highly recurrent (hot-spot) cytogenetic imbalance regions. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, for many genomic regions, a simple null-hypothesis of independence between cancer type and relative copy number alteration frequency can be rejected. Since a subset of these regions display relatively low overall CNA frequencies, they may point towards second-tier genomic targets that are adaptively relevant but not necessarily essential for cancer development.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-arrayMap-a/","title":"arrayMap: a reference resource for genomic copy number imbalances in human malignancies","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-arrayMap-a/#cai-h-kumar-n-baudis-m","title":"Cai H, Kumar N, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract BACKGROUND: The delineation of genomic copy number abnormalities (CNAs) from cancer samples has been instrumental for identification of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes and proven useful for clinical marker detection.

The duplications in 22q13 and Xq25q27 represent unique novel copy number variations but have an obvious influence on the phenotype. In 5 additional patients, the pathogenetic relevance of the detected variants remained unclear. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic submicroscopic imbalances were detectable in a significant proportion of patients with short stature and features reminiscent of SRS. Therefore, molecular karyotyping should be implemented in routine diagnostics for growth-retarded patients with even slight dysmorphisms suggestive for SRS.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2013-01-01-PKC-signaling/","title":"PKC signaling prevents irradiation-induced apoptosis of primary human fibroblasts","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2013-01-01-PKC-signaling/#bluwstein-a-kumar-n-leger-k-traenkle-j-oostrum-jv-rehrauer-h-baudis-m-hottiger-mo","title":"Bluwstein A, Kumar N, L\u00e9ger K, Traenkle J, Oostrum Jv, Rehrauer H, Baudis M, Hottiger MO.","text":"<p>Abstract Primary cells respond to irradiation by activation of the DNA damage response and cell cycle arrest, which eventually leads to senescence or apoptosis. It is not clear in detail which signaling pathways or networks regulate the induction of either apoptosis or senescence. Primary human fibroblasts are able to withstand high doses of irradiation and to prevent irradiation-induced apoptosis. However, the underlying regulatory basis for this phenotype is not well understood. Here, a kinetic network analysis based on reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs) in combination with extensive western blot and cell culture analyses was employed to decipher the cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling networks and to identify possible antiapoptotic pathways. This analysis identified activation of known DNA damage response pathways (e.g., phosphorylation of MKK3/6, p38, MK2, Hsp27, p53 and Chk1) as well as of prosurvival (e.g., MEK-ERK, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), protein kinase C (PKC)) and antiapoptotic markers (e.g., Bad, Bcl-2). Interestingly, PKC family members were activated early upon irradiation, suggesting a regulatory function in the ionizing radiation (IR) response of these cells. Inhibition or downregulation of PKC in primary human fibroblasts caused IR-dependent downregulation of the identified prosurvival (CREB phosphorylation) and antiapoptotic (Bad phosphorylation, Bcl-2) markers and thus lead to a proliferation stop and to apoptosis. Taken together, our analysis suggests that cytoplasmic PKC signaling conditions IR-stressed MRC-5 and IMR-90 cells to prevent irradiation-induced apoptosis. These findings contribute to the understanding of the cellular and nuclear IR response and may thus eventually improve the efficacy of radiotherapy and help overcome tumor radioresistance.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2013-02-01-High-resolution-copy/","title":"High resolution copy number analysis of IRF4 translocation-positive diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphomas","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2013-02-01-High-resolution-copy/#salaverria-i-martin-guerrero-i-burkhardt-b-kreuz-m-zenz-t-oschlies-i-arnold-n-baudis-m-bens-s-garcia-orad-a-lisfeld-j-schwaenen-c-szczepanowski-m-wessendorf-s-pfreundschuh-m-trumper-l-klapper-w-siebert-r","title":"Salaverria I, Martin-Guerrero I, Burkhardt B, Kreuz M, Zenz T, Oschlies I, Arnold N, Baudis M, Bens S, Garc\u00eda-Orad A, Lisfeld J, Schwaenen C, Szczepanowski M, Wessendorf S, Pfreundschuh M, Tr\u00fcmper L, Klapper W, Siebert R.","text":"<p>Abstract Translocations affecting chromosome subband 6p25.3 containing the IRF4 gene have been recently described as characteristic alterations in a molecularly distinct subset of germinal center B-cell-derived lymphomas.

More recently, mutations in the SIL1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident co-chaperone, were identified as the main cause of Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. Here we describe the results of SIL1 mutation analysis in 62 patients presenting with early-onset ataxia, cataracts and myopathy or combinations of at least two of these. We obtained a mutation detection rate of 60% (15/25) among patients with the characteristic Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome triad (ataxia, cataracts, myopathy) whereas the detection rate in the group of patients with more variable phenotypic presentation was below 3% (1/37). We report 16 unrelated families with a total of 19 different SIL1 mutations. Among these mutations are 15 previously unreported changes, including single- and multi-exon deletions. Based on data from our screening cohort and data compiled from the literature we found that SIL1 mutations are invariably associated with the combination of a cerebellar syndrome and chronic myopathy. Cataracts were observed in all patients beyond the age of 7 years, but might be missing in infants. Six patients with SIL1 mutations had no intellectual disability, extending the known wide range of cognitive capabilities in Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome to include normal intelligence. Modestly constant features were somatic growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities and pyramidal tract signs. Examination of mutant SIL1 expression in cultured patient lymphoblasts suggested that SIL1 mutations result in severely reduced SIL1 protein levels irrespective of the type and position of mutations. Our data broaden the SIL1 mutation spectrum and confirm that SIL1 is the major Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome gene. SIL1 patients usually present with the characteristic triad but cataracts might be missing in young children. As cognitive impairment is not obligatory, patients without intellectual disability but a Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome-compatible phenotype should receive SIL1 mutation analysis. Despite allelic heterogeneity and many families with private mutations, the phenotype related to SIL1 mutations is relatively homogenous. Based on SIL1 expression studies we speculate that this may arise from a uniform effect of different mutations on protein expression.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Biopsying-parapsoria/","title":"Biopsying parapsoriasis: quo vadis?

It was first named by Brocq, in 1902, as an entity with three components: pityriasis lichenoides, small plaque parapsoriasis and large plaque parapsoriasis. Nowadays, under the name of parapsoriasis are included only the last two categories, that are considered disorders characterized by the presence of a mononuclear infiltrate in the dermis, composed of T-cells. Until now, there were not established pathognomonic histopathological features to diagnose parapsoriasis. AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the epidemiological and morphological data of parapsoriasis cases diagnosed at Emergency City Hospital, Timisoara, Romania for a period of 12 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study had two parts; one was retrospective and another one prospective. For the retrospective part, we searched 210111 patient files recorded in our Pathology Service for a period of 11 years, from January 2002 to December 2012. The slides were searched from the archive and re-read by two individual pathologists. For prospective part of the study, we reviewed 11815 histological slides read between January and June 2013. After inspection of the recorded files, the pathologists noted, were available, the localization and number of the lesions, together with symptoms. The biopsied specimens were initially processed with routine histological technique, the archive slides being stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. While reading the slides, the pathologists paid attention to the architecture of the epidermis, the presence of epidermotropism and interface dermatitis, type of the dermal infiltrate and its distributions. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we emphasized the histopathological aspects of parapsoriasis in order to create a basic line that could help in the establishment of a uniformly accepted definition of parapsoriasis on histopathological grounds.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Chromothripsis-like/","title":"Chromothripsis-like patterns are recurring but heterogeneously distributed features in a survey of 22,347 cancer genome screens","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Chromothripsis-like/#cai-h-kumar-n-bagheri-hc-von-mering-c-robinson-md-baudis-m","title":"Cai H, Kumar N, Bagheri HC, von Mering C, Robinson MD, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract BACKGROUND: Chromothripsis is a recently discovered phenomenon of genomic rearrangement, possibly arising during a single genome-shattering event. This could provide an alternative paradigm in cancer development, replacing the gradual accumulation of genomic changes with a \"one-off\" catastrophic event. However, the term has been used with varying operational definitions, with the minimal consensus being a large number of locally clustered copy number aberrations. The mechanisms underlying these chromothripsis-like patterns (CTLP) and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we identified CTLP in 918 cancer samples, from a dataset of more than 22,000 oncogenomic arrays covering 132 cancer types. Fragmentation hotspots were found to be located on chromosome 8, 11, 12 and 17. Among the various cancer types, soft-tissue tumors exhibited particularly high CTLP frequencies. Genomic context analysis revealed that CTLP rearrangements frequently occurred in genomes that additionally harbored multiple copy number aberrations (CNAs). An investigation into the affected chromosomal regions showed a large proportion of arm-level pulverization and telomere related events, which would be compatible to a number of underlying mechanisms. We also report evidence that these genomic events may be correlated with patient age, stage and survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: Through a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets, this study characterized features associated with genomic aberrations patterns, compatible to the spectrum of \"chromothripsis\"-definitions as previously used. While quantifying clustered genomic copy number aberrations in cancer samples, our data indicates an underlying biological heterogeneity behind these chromothripsis-like patterns, beyond a well defined \"chromthripsis\" phenomenon.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Progenetix-12-years/","title":"Progenetix: 12 years of oncogenomic data curation","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Progenetix-12-years/#cai-h-kumar-n-ai-n-gupta-s-rath-p-baudis-m","title":"Cai H, Kumar N, Ai N, Gupta S, Rath P, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) can be found in the majority of cancer genomes and are crucial for understanding the potential mechanisms underlying tumor initiation and progression.
