Our work centres around our Progenetix resource of curated molecular-cytogenetic and sequencing data. Specific projects explore computational methods, genomics of selected tumour entities and genomic variant patterns across malignancies. As members of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, the group is developing standards in biocuration and data sharing for genomic variants and phenotypic data, for instance in driving development of the ELIXIR Beacon project. Other research is related to genome data epistemology, e.g. geographic and diagnostic sampling biases in cancer studies.

Between 1994 - 1998, he performed his research thesis in Molecular Cytogenetics in the group of Peter Lichter at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg, on the genomic analysis of malignant lymphomas, in the context of a multi-center clinical trial. He received his doctorate of the Medical Faculty of the Ruprecht-Karls Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg in 1999. </p> <p> While working as physician in Hematology &amp; Oncology at Heidelberg University Hospital, Dr. Baudis continued his research on the molecular cytogenetics and biology of hematologic neoplasias. In January 2001, he began a postdoctoral research project at Stanford University, in the group of Prof. Michael Cleary (Department of Pathology) with focus on the functional characterisation of E2A-HLF and E2A-PBX1 fusion genes in acute lymphoblastic leukemias, using in vitro cell line models with, array based gene expression analysis as well as murine essays. This work was extended during the following position as assistant professor at the University of Florida, starting in late 2003. </p> <p> During his thesis at the DKFZ, Michael became interested in the systematic collection of genome screening data, then from the CGH experiments performed at the Lichter lab. Supported by the University of Heidelberg's Medical School, he extended those early efforts to the systematic collection of original and publication derived genomic copy number data from malignant lymphomas. The website of the progenetix.net molecular cancer cytogenetics website was launched in early 2001, accompanied by a publication in Bioinformatics. </p> <p> After the position at UF and a brief stay at the RWTH Aachen (Human Genetics; 2006-2007), since August 2007 Michael has been a group leader and Professor of Bionformatics (2015) at the Department of Molecular Life Sciences of the University of Z\u00fcrich, as well as associated with the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics SIB. </p> <p> The work of his Computational Oncogenomics group is centered on the comparative analysis of genomic profiling data in cancer, with a focus on somatic copy number variations (CNV, CNA). With the Progenetix repository, the group provides one of the largest reference resources of curated genomic profiling and associated metadata covering the majority of cancer types. </p> <p> Apart from the analysis of cancer genome data, in recent years Michael has worked to facilitate the access to genomic data for research on a global scale. Since its founding in 2014, Michael has been a member of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health GA4GH, currently serving in the steering committee and as co-lead of its \"Discovery\" workstream and - since 2024 - as member of the GA4GH Strategic Leadership Committee. Related to the work in the Global Alliance, Michael also co-chairs the ELIXIR Beacon project, which develops APIs to query genomic data collections in a privacy-protecting manner. Here, the main focus on the group is in prototyping protocol extensions with demonstrator implementation in the Beacon+ project, connected to the Progenetix repository. </p> <p> In the Swiss context, Michael has been involved in advising the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) initiative and lead its \"Bioinformatics and Data Analytics\" working group. </p>"},{"location":"group/More-Alumni/","title":"More Alumni...","text":"<ul> <li>Martin Daellenbach</li> <li>Linda Grob, MSc (ETHZ)</li> <li>Alessio Milanese</li> <li>Nitin Kumar, PhD Cancer Biology LSZGS</li> <li>Haoyang Cai, PhD Cancer Biology LSZGS</li> <li>Kamal Kishore, MSc (UZH)</li> <li>Davide Polizzi</li> <li>Prisni Rath</li> </ul>"},{"location":"group/Ni-Ai/","title":"Ni Ai","text":"Contact Address Ni AiInstitute of Molecular Life SciencesUniversity of ZurichWinterthurerstrasse 190CH-8057 ZurichSwitzerland ORCID email github web Personal Date of birth Nationality email Education 2012 \u2013 current Research thesis in theoretical cancer genomics, Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Switzerland Employment"},{"location":"group/Paula-Carrio-Cordo/","title":"Paula Carrio Cordo","text":"Contact Address Paula Carrio CordoInstitute of Molecular Life SciencesUniversity of ZurichWinterthurerstrasse 190CH-8057 ZurichSwitzerland ORCID email paula.carriocordo@uzh.ch github @paulacarrio Personal Date of birth 30.07.1992 Nationality Spanish Education 2021-04-21 PhD in Molecular Life Sciences of the Faculty of Sciences, University of Zurich 2017 \u2013 2021 Research thesis in theoretical cancer genomics, Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Switzerland 2016 \u2013 2017 Master of Science in Quantitative Biology and Systems Biology, University of Zurich, Switzerland 2013 \u2013 2014 Erasmus exchange - Bachelor of Science in Biology, University of Zurich, Switzerland 2010 \u2013 2015 Bachelor of Science in Biology, University of Oviedo, Spain Employment 08/2017 \u2013 current PhD candidate in Life Science Zurich Graduate School, University of Zurich, Switzerland 07/2017 \u2013 08/2017 Bioinformatician at European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI Hinxton), United Kingdom 06/2015 \u2013 09/2015 Research assistant at National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRA Dijon), France 06/2014 \u2013 09/2014 Research assistant at Department of Evolutionary Biology, University of Zurich, Switzerland"},{"location":"group/Qingyao-Huang/","title":"Qingyao Huang","text":"Contact Address Qingyao HuangInstitute of Molecular Life SciencesUniversity of ZurichWinterthurerstrasse 190CH-8057 ZurichSwitzerland ORCID 0000-0002-8255-4722 email qingyao.huang@uzh.ch github @qingyao Personal Nationality P.R.

However, as these models transition from analyzing population-scale germline data to the more complex landscape of tumor genomes, two critical concerns emerge: whether their learned representations can maintain accuracy across diverse sequencing technologies, and whether clinicians can develop sufficient trust in the latent patterns driving the model predictions.</p> <p>Our ongoing research addresses these challenges through a transfer learning approach, adapting existing genomic language models using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from the ICGC Pan-Cancer cohort. Instead of using pre-processed variant calls, we train models directly on raw sequencing data containing both somatic and germline variations, forcing the architecture to develop its own representations of complex genomic alterations, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs), structural rearrangements (SVs), large-scale insertions/deletions (indels), and copy-number variations (CNVs). </p> <p>To validate our approach, we focus on two key aspects: first, evaluating model generalization by testing fine-tuned versions across multiple independent WGS cancer cohorts with varying technical characteristics; and second, implementing explainability techniques that combine attention mechanisms with feature occlusion tests to identify which genomic segments most influence tumor classification predictions. These model-derived insights are then compared against established driver-gene databases and clinical annotations to assess biological plausibility and clinical relevance.</p> <p>Clinical translation of genomic AI requires both robust multi-dataset validation and biologically interpretable predictions to realize its potential for analyzing complex sequencing data. By addressing these challenges, we aim to bridge the gap between computational innovation and clinically practical insights, paving the way for more trustworthy and generalizable AI applications in precision oncology.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2025-07-09-Beacon-day-at-McGill/","title":"Beacon - History, Future, Implementations","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2025-07-09-Beacon-day-at-McGill/#workshop-summary","title":"Workshop Summary","text":"<p>This workshop explores genomic resources from the Canadian context and how current and future versions of the Beacon  standard can be utilized for data discovery and exchange.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2025-07-09-Beacon-day-at-McGill/#attendees","title":"Attendees","text":"<ul> <li>Michael Baudis (University of Zurich)</li> <li>David Bujold (McGill)</li> <li>David Morais (HSJ)</li> <li>Karen Cranston (UHN)</li> <li>Francis Nguyen (UHN)</li> <li>Sanjeev Lakhwani (McGill)</li> <li>JB Poline (McGill)</li> <li>Sebastian Urchs (McGill)</li> <li>Victor Rochelau (McGill)</li> <li>Justin Richardsson (OICR)</li> <li>Yann Joly (McGill)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"presentations/2025-09-19-Michael-CBB-MSc-presentation/","title":"Theoretical Cytogenetics and Oncogenomics","text":"<p>The presentation at the ETH Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering D-BSSE in Basel introduced the baudisgroup's projects to incoming students of the Computational Biology und Bioinformatics MSc program.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2025-10-07-Michael-GA4GH-poster/","title":"Implementing the GA4GH Beacon API for Genomic Discovery and Sharing in an Open Data Paradigm","text":"<p>Abstract Besides the discovery of genomic and pheno-clinic data in different access settings, the GA4GH Beacon protocol also enables the retrieval of matched records through a variety of open or protected mechanisms, depending on the resources\u2019 data structure as well as data protection and regulatory requirements.

Such a data repository could be valuable in identifying genetic aberration patterns with linkage to specific disease entities, and provide additional information for validating data from large scale expression array experiments.</p> <p>A case and band specific aberration matrix was selected as most suitable format for the mining of CGH data. The [progenetix.net] data repository was developed to provide the according data to the research community for a growing number of human malignancies.</p> <p>In the current implementation, two main purposes are being served. First, access to the band specific pattern of chromosomal imbalances allows the instantaneous identification of genomic \u201chotspots\u201d. Second, the band specific aberration matrices can be included in data mining efforts. As an example, the clustering off all informative cases from the current (September 2001) dataset is shown here (online source under www.progenetix.net/bcats/clustered.png).</p> <p>Data selection PubMed is searched for publications applying CGH to the analysis of malignant tumors. Articles are selected according to their online availability and the description of genomic imbalances on a per case basis.</p> <p>Transformation of input data Chromosomal aberration data is transformed via customized parsing commands to a common format adherent to ISCN 1995 recommendations. In some cases, aberration data was transcribed from graphical representations or provided by the authors.</p> <p>Data storage Currently, the primary data is stored in a dedicated \u201coff-line\u201d database. Besides case identifier and ISCN adapted chromosomal imbalance data, tumor classification and source information including the PubMed identifier is recorded. Disease entities are reclassified to ICD-O-3 codes.</p> <p>Text parsing and generation of aberration matrix For the generation of the case and band specific aberration matrix, a dedicated text pattern comparison model was developed using Perl. Briefly, for each chromosomal band, the aberration field of each case is searched for a variety of patterns containing aberration information applying to that band. A matrix with currently 324 band resolution is generated, annotating chromosomal gains with \u201c1\u201d and losses with \u201c\u20131\u201d; localized high- level gains are designated \u201c2\u201c.</p> <p>Website generation For graphical representation of chromosomal imbalances, HTML pages containing different views of the underlying aberration matrices are generated using Perl. Graphics are implemented using HTML syntax. Besides band specific, whole genomic overviews, chromosome specific pages with links to all involved cases are generated for each ICD-O-3 entity as well as for each registered project.

A central component is the development of standardised data schemas and application programming interfaces (APIs), for molecular screening data as well as biological and technical metadata.</p> <p>In addition to direct schema development, demonstration projects explore strategies and limitations of federated data access and attempt to engage active participants from different areas of biomedical research and clinical practice as well as experts from areas such as computer and network security, law and ethics. One of the main demonstrators has been the \u201cBeacon\u201d project, which through a lightweight \u201cbeacon-network\u201d registry and API allows the querying for specific genome sequence variants at resources from all over the world.</p> <p>Early on, the main focus of GA4GH was on demonstrating functionality and to engage participants through through low-complexity scenarios. However, increased utility of GA4GH schemas requires representation of common biological, health specific and technical metadata.</p> <p>The Metadata Task Team (MTT) of the GA4GH Data Working Group (DWG) has been working on defining the part of the schema representation which not primarily addresses primary or derived \u201comics\u201d (e.g. sequences, variants) data. Core principles of schema development have been the restriction of schema complexity, the use of standardised data formats (e.g. ISO time), and the prominent use of ontologies as externally maintained value descriptors.</p> <p>An important benchmark for a given data schema is the successful projection of reference datasets. However, so far the mapping of rich metadata attributes and structures into the GA4GH schema has not been explored for large, real world datasets or reference repositories.</p> <p>As part of an ELIXIR \u201chuman data implementation study\u201d, we have started to implement datasets as schema-compatible resources, and to explore linking these to external reference services for biomedical ontologies. At the core of this project, we are using the arraymap.org reference database for molecular genomic profiling data in cancer, which contains data from oncogenomic copy number analyses and curated metadata. The study has been directed at testing the GA4GH object model, with a focus on metadata, and at using this experience to guide schema development efforts of the GA4GH MTT. </p> <p>Additionally, as part of a parallel ELIXIR study, our GA4GH conform representation arrayMap data tests forward looking developments of genomic \"Beacons\", with focus on structural genome variants, the inclusion of metadata parameters for data queries, and the development of query interfaces and informative Beacon response formats.</p> <p>At the present time, our test implementation represents &gt;55\u2019000 genomic call sets and allows the direct use of variant and metadata queries against a set of database collections implemented in MongoDB. A first API implementation provides responses to Beacon-style queries, e.g. the frequency of a variant for a tumor type specified through an ontology term.</p> <p>Ongoing efforts aim to promote rapid evolution of the GA4GH metadata schema for a variety of data types and proposed use cases, such as geolocation data, metagenomic applications and temporal relations. On the implementation side, next steps include the integration of ontology services for data query and ingestion scenarios, as well as the extension of the demonstrator API for rich metadata query scenarios. An important part of current and future developments will be the use of additional data resources for demonstration projects.</p> <p>Example datasets as well as tools and documentation are made available through the \u201carraymap2ga4gh\u201d project on Github.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2017-09-13-talk-bc2-michael/#highlights","title":"Highlights","text":"<p>This presentation will be aimed at reporting the current status of the GA4GH schema development with focus on the lessons learned from the data implementation studies, as well as the challenges from design and implementation of data concepts centred around modern object based biodata data standards with heavy dependency on ontologies.

Next, we will perform haplotype phasing and linkage mapping to propose potential population-specific cancer-predisposing variants.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2018-09-08-abstract-ECCB-Michael/","title":"ECCB 2018 - Beacon","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2018-09-08-abstract-ECCB-Michael/#abstract-eccb-2018","title":"Abstract: ECCB 2018","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2018-09-08-abstract-ECCB-Michael/#elixir-beacon-a-driver-project-for-the-global-alliance-for-genomics-and-health","title":"ELIXIR Beacon - A Driver Project for the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2018-09-08-abstract-ECCB-Michael/#michael-baudis-for-the-elixir-beacon-project","title":"Michael Baudis for the ELIXIR Beacon Project","text":"<p>The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) develops standards and guidelines to facilitate the international sharing of genomic and health related metadata.

While germline CNVs are a majorcontributor to genomic syndromes and inherited diseases, the majority of cancersaccumulate extensive \u201dsomatic\u201d CNV (sCNV or CNA) during the process ofoncogenetic transformation and progression. While specific sCNV have closelybeen associated with tumorigenesis, intriguingly many neoplasias exhibitrecurrent sCNV patterns beyond the involvement of a few cancer driver genes.Currently, CNV profiles of tumor samples are generated using genomicmicro-arrays or high-throughput DNA sequencing. Regardless of the underlyingtechnology, genomic copy number data is derived from the relative assessmentand integration of multiple signals, with the data generation process being proneto contamination from several sources. Estimated copy number values have noabsolute and linear correlation to their corresponding DNA levels, and the extentof deviation differs between sample profiles which poses a great challenge fordata integration and comparison in large scale genome analysis.</p> <p>Results: In this study, we present a novel method named Minimum ErrorCalibration and Normalization of Copy Numbers Analysis (Mecan4CNA). Foreach sCNV profile,Mecan4CNAreduces the noise level, calculates valuesrepresenting the normal DNA copies (baseline) and the change of one copy (leveldistance), and finally normalizes all values. Experiments ofMecan4CNAonsimulated data showed an overall accuracy of 93% and 91% in determining thebaseline and level distance, respectively. Comparison of baseline and level distanceestimation with existing methods and karyotyping data on the NCI-60 tumor cellline produced coherent results. To estimate the method\u2019s impact on downstreamanalyses we performed GISTIC analyses on original andMecan4CNAdata fromthe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) where the normalized data showed prominentimprovements of both sensitivity and specificity in detecting focal regions.</p> <p>Conclusions:  In general,Mecan4CNAprovides an advanced method for CNAdata normalization especially in research involving data of high volume andheterogeneous quality. With its informative output and visualization, it can alsofacilitate analysis of individual CNA profiles.Mecan4CNAis freely available as aPython package and through Github.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2019-09-10-poster-Qingyao/","title":"Cancer cell lines in focus: somatic copy number & germline variation","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2019-09-10-poster-Qingyao/#bc2-2019-basel","title":"BC2 2019, Basel","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2019-09-10-poster-Qingyao/#qingyao-huang","title":"Qingyao Huang","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2019-09-10-poster-Qingyao/#abstract","title":"Abstract","text":"<p>Background: Human cell lines are convenient model systems in cancer research, for validation of proposed molecular mechanisms as well as to evaluate potential therapeutic approaches, e.g. through high- throughput screening of potential anti-tumour compounds against cancer cell line panels.

In addition, manually curated ontology terms based on retrieved metadata are available, as defined by NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) and International Classification of Diseases-Ontology (ICD-O). For germline analysis, we performed genome-wide phasing and imputation to integrate samples from various array platforms. Then, we estimated kinship and built phylogenetic trees based on germline similarity.</p> <p>Results: We confirmed the close relatedness within cell lines as well as between cell lines of similar ethnic origin. For somatic variation, we clustered CNV patterns and evaluated the consistency between cell lines and the primary tutor sample data of the same origin.</p> <p>Conclusions:  We analysed both somatic variation and germline signature within the same cell lines, to evaluate dynamic genome changes related to cell line propagation, as well as to determine instances of mis- assignment based on strong genomic profile divergence. As a research output, we provide the germline lineage tree and somatic CNV clustering for available cancer cell lines as an online resource.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2001-2019/2019-10-08-symposion-AMED-Tokyo-Michael/","title":"Talk at AMED Tokyo -

While point mutations can be pinpointed to a targeted genetic element, copy number variations (CNVs) involve copy number gain or loss of a large DNA segment which often covers hundreds of genetic elements in one event. Although the vast majority of variations are not directly fucntionally cancer promoting, we observe consistency in CNV landscape within the same cancer types and corresponding increase in heterogeneity along with increased distinction in physiology and morphology. This implies that particular CNV may promote cancer type-specific progression. Previously, it was observed that a focal CNV (with length shorter than 3Mb) indicated stronger functional relevance than large-scale CNV. In addition, we observe higher frequency of CNV segment start and end points near known driver genes. Taken together, we designed a statistic that harness properties of collective CNV segments, to delineate the non-random alteration of genes exerted through CNV. Using 9 different cancer types from multiple sources and platforms, we ranked all genes in the genome for their importance based on the CNV data. The same cancer types cluster together by genome-wide significance scores. Known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can be found at the top. We have also compared with GISTIC2.0 using the same data and identified similar regional peaks, but this method can provide significance measure on the gene level. With the confirmatory results on the known tumor promoting genes, this work has a potential to identify novel functional pathways that are exerted through CNV. </p>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-03-29-Michael-Baudis__CNVs%2C-Progenetix%2C-Beacon-and-GA4GH__Kinderspital-Neuroonkologie/","title":"Implementing GA4GH Standards to Drive an Open Oncogenomics Resource","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-03-29-Michael-Baudis__CNVs%2C-Progenetix%2C-Beacon-and-GA4GH__Kinderspital-Neuroonkologie/#michael-baudis","title":"Michael Baudis","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-03-29-Michael-Baudis__CNVs%2C-Progenetix%2C-Beacon-and-GA4GH__Kinderspital-Neuroonkologie/#seminar-neurooncology-childrens-hospital-zurich","title":"Seminar Neurooncology Childrens Hospital Z\u00fcrich","text":"<p>This seminar gives an overview of the history &amp; current state of the Progenetix resource, it's role in Beacon API development and the overall connection to the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH).</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-04-20-Michael-Baudis__ELIXIR-Beacon__RDA/","title":"Progenetix, Beacon and GA4GH at RDA","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-04-20-Michael-Baudis__ELIXIR-Beacon__RDA/#concepts-status-history-outlook","title":"Concepts | Status | History | Outlook","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-04-20-Michael-Baudis__ELIXIR-Beacon__RDA/#michael-baudis","title":"Michael Baudis","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-04-20-Michael-Baudis__ELIXIR-Beacon__RDA/#research-data-alliance-rda-virtual-plenary-17","title":"Research Data Alliance - RDA Virtual Plenary 17","text":"<p>This seminar gives an overview of current state of the Progenetix Beacon project and the overall connection to the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH).</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-06-08-Michael-Baudis__hCNV-Progenetix-Beacon__ELIXIR-All-Hands/","title":"hCNV data and the Progenetix Beacon","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-06-08-Michael-Baudis__hCNV-Progenetix-Beacon__ELIXIR-All-Hands/#michael-baudis","title":"Michael Baudis","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-06-08-Michael-Baudis__hCNV-Progenetix-Beacon__ELIXIR-All-Hands/#elixir-all-hands-2021","title":"ELIXIR All Hands 2021","text":"<p>This presentation gives a brief overview of the use of the Progenetix resource to test and implement a genomics reference resource using the emerging Beacon v2 protocol.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-06-11-Michael-Baudis__hCNV-implementation-studies__ELIXIR-Human-Data-Day/","title":"hCNV Community and Implementation Studies","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-06-11-Michael-Baudis__hCNV-implementation-studies__ELIXIR-Human-Data-Day/#michael-baudis","title":"Michael Baudis","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-06-11-Michael-Baudis__hCNV-implementation-studies__ELIXIR-Human-Data-Day/#elixir-all-hands-2021-human-data-day","title":"ELIXIR All Hands 2021 Human Data Day","text":"<p>At the Human Data Day Michael presents a very brief overview of the ending and upcoming ELIXIR hCNV implementation studies.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-08-03-Qingyao-Huang__Progenetix-oncogenomic-resource__CGC-talk/","title":"Progenetix - An open reference resource for copy number vatiation data in cancer","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-08-03-Qingyao-Huang__Progenetix-oncogenomic-resource__CGC-talk/#qingyao-huang","title":"Qingyao Huang","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-08-03-Qingyao-Huang__Progenetix-oncogenomic-resource__CGC-talk/#additional-links","title":"Additional Links","text":"<ul> <li>Video Recording of Presentation</li> <li>Slides PDF</li> </ul>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-08-31-Michael-Baudis__Progenetix-GA4GH-standards__ESHG-2021/","title":"Cancer genomics reference resource and toolkit around GA4GH standards","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2021-08-31-Michael-Baudis__Progenetix-GA4GH-standards__ESHG-2021/#q-huang-b-gao-r-paloots-p-carrio-cordo-z-yang-m-baudis","title":"Q.

While specific CNV events and some recurring patterns have contributed to the identification of individual cancer drivers and the recognition of cancer  subtypes, the complexity of genomic CNV patterns requires large amounts of well-defined genomic profiles for statistically meaningful analyses. At the other end of the spectrum, in the area of rare disease genomics the potential pathogenicity of individual CNV events requires validation against a vast set of disease-related and reference genomic profiles and annotations.</p> <p>Methods The \u201cBeacon\u201d protocol - developed with support from ELIXIR, the European bioinformatics infrastructure organization, as a standard of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) - represents an emerging standard for an \u201cInternet for Genomics\u201d. While the initial version of the protocol served as a widely adopted test bed for the sharing of genomic variants over federated query systems connecting hundreds of internationally distributed resources, the version 2 of the protocol aims at providing a framework for extended, metadata-rich query and response options in both public and restricted federated access scenarios. Throughout the development of Beacon v2, the Progenetix cancer genomics resource (progenetix.org) - including the largest publicly accessible set of cancer CNV data - has served as a testbed for implementation of Beacon v2 protocol features. </p> <p>Results With the implementation of the Beacon v2 API as backbone of the Progenetix resource - serving genome-wide CNV profiling data from more than 130\u2019000 individual experiments, representing over 700 diagnostic entities and  more that 1\u2019500 published studies - we could demonstrate the use of the GA4GH Beacon v2 protocol as a practical solution for the sharing of vast amounts of genomic profiling data, in a open setting and using a documented, completely open API for third party use. Conclusion:</p> <p>With the Beacon v2 protocol - as a major upgrade from the v1 standard - currently being under review as GA4GH standard, work is focussing on its implementation in a wide set of use cases, from access protected clinical information systems to public-access research databases. Importantly, an ELIXIR-supported implementation study by members of the ELIXIR h-CNV community (cnvar.org) will explore the generation of Beacon v2 powered CNV implementations by various major European genomics resources, in the fields of human genetics / rare diseases and cancer genomics.</p> <p>References</p> <ul> <li>Huang, Q., Carrio-Cordo, P., Gao, B., Paloots, R., &amp; Baudis, M.

Here we build a cancer cell line variant resource for easier cell line identification and to enable finding the best representation for the cell line. This resource is open-source and uses the Beacon protocol for facilitated data sharing. To make this cell line variant knowledge resource complete we have also included cell line metadata and known single nucleotide variants to our database. </p>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2022-06-27-Michael-Baudis__Progenetix-and-BeaconPlus__Roche-data-science-seminar/","title":"A cancer genomics reference resource powered by GA4GH standards","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2022-06-27-Michael-Baudis__Progenetix-and-BeaconPlus__Roche-data-science-seminar/#michael-baudis","title":"Michael Baudis","text":"<p>The presentation reports about the Progenetix cancer genomics resource and its role in the GA4GH ecosystem &amp; the Beacon genomics API development process.</p>"},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2022-07-31-Rahel_CGC/","title":"A cancer genomics resource built on GA4GH standards","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2022-07-31-Rahel_CGC/#rahel-paloots-michael-baudis","title":"Rahel Paloots, Michael Baudis","text":""},{"location":"presentations/2020-2022/2022-07-31-Rahel_CGC/#cgc-st-louis-2022","title":"CGC St Louis 2022","text":"<p>Progenetix is a cancer genomics resource that includes genomic profiling data as well as biomedical annotations and provenance data for cancer studies.

Nuclear poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) formation is thought to be induced in response to oxidative DNA damage and to promote cell death under sustained oxidative stress conditions. However, what exactly triggers PAR induction in response to oxidative stress is incompletely understood. Using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and in-depth analysis of key stress signaling components, we observed that PAR formation induced by H2O2 was mediated by the PLC/IP3R/Ca(2+)/PKC\u03b1 signaling axis. Mechanistically, H2O2-induced PAR formation correlated with Ca(2+)-dependent DNA damage, which, however, was PKC\u03b1-independent. In contrast, PAR formation was completely lost upon knockdown of PKC\u03b1, suggesting that DNA damage alone was not sufficient for inducing PAR formation, but required a PKC\u03b1-dependent process. Intriguingly, the loss of PAR formation observed upon PKC\u03b1 depletion was overcome when the chromatin structure-modifying protein HMGB1 was co-depleted with PKC\u03b1, suggesting that activation and nuclear translocation of PKC\u03b1 releases the inhibitory effect of HMGB1 on PAR formation. Together, these results identify PKC\u03b1 and HMGB1 as important co-regulators involved in H2O2-induced PAR formation, a finding that may have important relevance for oxidative stress-associated pathophysiological conditions.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2016-09-01-PKC%CE%B1-and-HMGB1/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>EPMC</li> <li>PDF</li> </ul>"},{"location":"publications/2016-10-01-CNARA-reliability/","title":"CNARA: reliability assessment for genomic copy number profiles","text":""},{"location":"publications/2016-10-01-CNARA-reliability/#ai-n-cai-h-solovan-c-baudis-m","title":"Ai N, Cai H, Solovan C, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract DNA copy number profiles from microarray and sequencing experiments sometimes contain wave artefacts which may be introduced during sample preparation and cannot be removed completely by existing preprocessing methods. Besides, large derivative log ratio spread (DLRS) of the probes correlating with poor DNA quality is sometimes observed in genome screening experiments and may lead to unreliable copy number profiles. Depending on the extent of these artefacts and the resulting misidentification of copy number alterations/variations (CNA/CNV), it may be desirable to exclude such samples from analyses or to adapt the downstream data analysis strategy accordingly.Here, we propose a method to distinguish reliable genomic copy number profiles from those containing heavy wave artefacts and/or large DLRS. We define four features that adequately summarize the copy number profiles for reliability assessment, and train a classifier on a dataset of 1522 copy number profiles from various microarray platforms. The method can be applied to predict the reliability of copy number profiles irrespective of the underlying microarray platform and may be adapted for those sequencing platforms from which copy number estimates could be computed as a piecewise constant signal. Further details can be found at github.com/baudisgroup/CNARA .We have developed a method for the assessment of genomic copy number profiling data, and suggest to apply the method in addition to and after other state-of-the-art noise correction and quality control procedures.

Disentangling the effects related to particular population backgrounds can help in both understanding cancer biology and in tailoring therapeutic interventions. Because self-reported or inferred patient data can be incomplete or misleading due to migration and genomic admixture, a data-driven ancestry estimation should be preferred. While tools to map and utilize ancestry information from healthy individuals have been introduced, a population assignment based on genotyping data from somatic variation profiling of cancer samples is still missing. We analyzed sequencing-based variation data from the 1000 Genomes project, containing 2504 individuals out of 5 continental groups. This reference was then used to extract population-biased SNPs used in genotyping array platforms of varying resolutions. We found that despite widespread and extensive somatic mutations of cancer profiling data, more than 90% of cancer samples can be correctly mapped to one of the population group when compared to their paired unmutated normals. Pre-filtering samples for admixed individuals increased the accuracy to 96%. This work provides a data-driven approach to estimate the population background from cancer genome profiling data.

Disentangling the effects related to particular population backgrounds can help in both understanding cancer biology and in tailoring therapeutic interventions. Because self-reported or inferred patient data can be incomplete or misleading due to migration and genomic admixture, a data-driven ancestry estimation should be preferred. While algorithms to analyze ancestry structure from healthy individuals have been developed, an easy-to-use tool to assign population groups based on genotyping data from SNP profiles is still missing and benchmarking for the validity of population assignment strategy for aberrant cancer genomes was not tested. We benchmarked the consistency and accuracy of cross-platform population assignment. We also demonstrated its high accuracy to process unaltered as well as cancer genomes. Despite widespread and extensive somatic mutations of cancer profiling data, population assignment consistency between germline and highly mutated samples from cancer patients reached of 97% and 92% for assignment into 5 and 26 populations respectively. Comparison of our benchmarked results with self- reported meta-data estimated a matching rate between 88 % to 92%. Despite a relatively high matching rate, the ethnicity labels indicated in meta-data are vague compared to the stan- dardized output from our tool. We have developed a bioinformatics tool to assign the populations from genome profiling data and validated its performance in healthy as well as aberrant cancer genomes. It is ready-to-use for genotyping data from nine commercial SNP array platforms or sequencing data. This tool is effective to scrutinize the population structure in cancer genomes and provides better measure to integrate genotyping data from various platforms instead of self-reported information. It will facilitate research on interplay between ethnicity related genetic background and molecular patterns in cancer entities and disentangling possible hereditary contributions.

Whether specific vulnerabilities to PARPi exist beyond BRCA mutations and related defects in homology-directed repair (HDR) is not well understood. Here, we identify the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIP12 as negative regulator of PARPi sensitivity. We show that TRIP12 controls steady-state PARP1 levels and limits PARPi-induced cytotoxic PARP1 trapping. Upon loss of TRIP12, elevated PARPi-induced PARP1 trapping causes increased DNA replication stress, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TRIP12 binds PARP1 via a central PAR-binding WWE domain and, using its carboxy-terminal HECT domain, catalyzes polyubiquitylation of PARP1, triggering proteasomal degradation and preventing supra-physiological PARP1 accumulation. Further, in cohorts of breast and ovarian cancer patients, PARP1 abundance is negatively correlated with TRIP12 expression. We thus propose TRIP12 as regulator of PARP1 stability and PARPi-induced PARP trapping, with potential implications for PARPi sensitivity and resistance.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2020-10-13-The-ELIXIR-Human-Copy-Number-Variations-Community/","title":"The ELIXIR Human Copy Number Variations Community: building bioinformatics infrastructure for research","text":""},{"location":"publications/2020-10-13-The-ELIXIR-Human-Copy-Number-Variations-Community/#salgado-d-armean-im-baudis-m-et-al","title":"Salgado D, Armean IM, Baudis M et al.","text":""},{"location":"publications/2020-10-13-The-ELIXIR-Human-Copy-Number-Variations-Community/#f1000research-2020-9-elixir1229","title":"F1000Research 2020, 9 (ELIXIR):1229","text":"<p>Abstract Copy number variations (CNVs) are major causative contributors both in the genesis of genetic diseases and human neoplasias.

While the impact of many point mutations can be evaluated through their modification of individual genomic elements, even a single copy number aberration (CNA) may encompass hundreds of genes and therefore pose challenges to untangle potentially complex functional effects. However, consistent, recurring and disease-specific patterns in the genome-wide CNA landscape imply that particular CNA may promote cancer-type-specific characteristics. Discerning essential cancer-promoting alterations from the inherent co-dependency in CNA would improve the understanding of mechanisms of CNA and provide new insights into cancer biology and potential therapeutic targets.</p> <p>Here we implement a model using segmental breakpoints to discover non-random gene coverage by copy number deletion (CND). With a diverse set of cancer types from multiple resources, this model identified common and cancer-type-specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes as well as cancer-promoting functional pathways. Confirmed by differential expression analysis of data from corresponding cancer types, the results show that for most cancer types, despite dissimilarity of their CND landscapes, similar canonical pathways are affected. In 25 analyses of 17 cancer types, we have identified 19 to 169 significant genes by copy deletion, including RB1, PTEN and CDKN2A as the most significantly deleted genes among all cancer types. We have also shown a shared dependence on core pathways for cancer progression in different cancers as well as cancer type separation by genome-wide significance scores. While this work provides a reference for gene specific significance in many cancers, it chiefly contributes a general framework to derive genome-wide significance and molecular insights in CND profiles with a potential for the analysis of rare cancer types as well as non-coding regions.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2023-05-17-phenopackets-tools/","title":"Phenopacket-tools: Building and validating GA4GH Phenopackets","text":""},{"location":"publications/2023-05-17-phenopackets-tools/#danis-d-jacobsen-job-wagner-ah-groza-t-beckwith-ma-rekerle-l-carmody-lc-reese-j-hegde-h-ladewig-ms-seitz-b-munoz-torres-m-harris-nl-rambla-j-baudis-m-mungall-cj-haendel-ma-robinson-pn-2023-phenopacket-tools-building-and-validating-ga4gh-phenopackets-plos-one-18e0285433","title":"Danis D, Jacobsen JOB, Wagner AH, Groza T, Beckwith MA, Rekerle L, Carmody LC, Reese J, Hegde H, Ladewig MS, Seitz B, Munoz-Torres M, Harris NL, Rambla J, Baudis M, Mungall CJ, Haendel MA, Robinson PN.

The GA4GH Phenopacket Schema is a standard for sharing disease and phenotype information that characterizes an individual person or biosample. The Phenopacket Schema is flexible and can represent clinical data for any kind of human disease including rare disease, complex disease, and cancer. It also allows consortia or databases to apply additional constraints to ensure uniform data collection for specific goals. We present phenopacket-tools, an open-source Java library and command-line application for construction, conversion, and validation of phenopackets. Phenopacket-tools simplifies construction of phenopackets by providing concise builders, programmatic shortcuts, and predefined building blocks (ontology classes) for concepts such as anatomical organs, age of onset, biospecimen type, and clinical modifiers. Phenopacket-tools can be used to validate the syntax and semantics of phenopackets as well as to assess adherence to additional user-defined requirements. The documentation includes examples showing how to use the Java library and the command-line tool to create and validate phenopackets. We demonstrate how to create, convert, and validate phenopackets using the library or the command-line application. Source code, API documentation, comprehensive user guide and a tutorial can be found at github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-tools. The library can be installed from the public Maven Central artifact repository and the application is available as a standalone archive.

While STR length variations are known to regulate gene expression under physiological conditions, the functional impact of STR mutations in CRC remains unclear. Here, we integrate STR mutation data with clinical information and gene expression levels to study the gene regulatory effects of STR mutations in CRC. We confirm that STR mutability in CRC highly depends on the MSI status, repeat unit size, and repeat length. Furthermore, we present a set of 1244 putative expression STRs (eSTRs) for which the STR length is associated with gene expression levels in CRC tumours. The length of 73 eSTRs is associated with expression levels of cancer-related genes, nine of which are CRC-specific genes. We show that linear models describing eSTR-gene expression relationships allow for predictions of gene expression changes in response to eSTR mutations. Moreover, we found an increased mutability of eSTRs in MSI tumours. Our evidence of gene regulatory roles for eSTRs in CRC highlights a mostly overlooked way through which tumours may modulate their phenotypes. The increased mutability of eSTRs in MSI tumours may be an early indication that eSTR mutations can confer a selective advantage to tumours. Future extensions of our findings into larger cohorts could uncover new STR-based targets in the treatment of cancer.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2023-12-28-labelseg/","title":"labelSeg: segment annotation for tumor copy number alteration profiles","text":""},{"location":"publications/2023-12-28-labelseg/#hangjia-zhao-and-michael-baudis","title":"Hangjia Zhao and Michael Baudis","text":""},{"location":"publications/2023-12-28-labelseg/#briefings-in-bioinformatics-oxford-2024-jan-312024bbad541","title":"Briefings in Bioinformatics (Oxford). 2024 Jan 31;2024:bbad541.","text":"<ul> <li>doi: 10.1093/bib/bbad541</li> <li>PMID: 38300514</li> <li>bioRxiv. doi: 10.1101/2023.05.17.541097</li> </ul> <p>Abstract Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) are a predominant type of oncogenomic alterations that affect a large proportion of the genome in the majority of cancer samples.

Its compatibility with most CNA measurement platforms makes it suitable for large-scale integrative data analysis. We confirmed its performance on both simulated and sample-derived data from The Cancer Genome Atlas reference dataset, and we demonstrated its utility in integrating heterogeneous segment profiles from different data sources and measurement platforms.

Here, we leverage whole-exome sequencing and gene expression data to identify STRs for which repeat lengths are associated with the expression of nearby genes (eSTRs) in colorectal, stomach, and endometrial tumors. While most eSTRs are cancer-specific, shared eSTRs across multiple cancers exhibit consistent effects on gene expression. Notably, coding-region eSTRs identified in all three cancer types show positive correlations with nearby gene expression. We further validate the functional effects of eSTRs by demonstrating associations between somatic eSTR mutations and gene expression changes during the transition from normal to tumor tissues, suggesting their potential roles in tumorigenesis. Combined with DNA methylation data, we perform the first quantitative analysis of the interplay between STR variations and DNA methylation in tumors. We identify eSTRs where repeat lengths are associated with methylation levels of nearby CpG sites (meSTRs) and show that &gt;70% of eSTRs are significantly linked to local DNA methylation.

With increasing malignancy grade, a marked accumulation of genomic aberrations was observed; i.e., the numbers (mean +/- SEM) of total alterations detected per tumor were 2.9 +/- 0.7 for MI, 9.2 +/- 1.2 for MII, and 13.3 +/- 1.9 for MIII.

METHODS: In order to further define specific DNA copy number changes in cervical cancer, we analyzed 20 cervical samples (3 pre-malignant lesions, 10 invasive tumors, and 7 cell lines), using the GenoSensor microarray CGH system to define particular genetic targets that suffer copy number changes. RESULTS: The most common DNA gains detected by array CGH in the invasive samples were located at the RBP1-RBP2 (3q21-q22) genes, the sub-telomeric clone C84C11/T3 (5ptel), D5S23 (5p15.2) and the DAB2 gene (5p13) in 58.8% of the samples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published CGH data from 231 primary untreated neuroblastomas were converted to a digitized format suitable for global data mining, subgroup discovery, and multivariate survival analyses. RESULTS: In contrast to previous reports, which included only a few genetic parameters, we present here for the first time a strategy that allows unbiased evaluation of all genetic imbalances detected by CGH. The presented approach firmly established the existence of three different clinicogenetic subgroups and indicated that chromosome 17 status and tumor stage were the only independent significant predictors for patient outcome. Important new findings were: (1) a normal chromosome 17 status as a delineator of a subgroup of presumed favorable-stage tumors with highly increased risk; (2) the recognition of a survivor signature conferring 100% 5-year survival for stage 1, 2, and 4S tumors presenting with whole chromosome 17 gain; and (3) the identification of 3p deletion as a hallmark of older age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: We propose a new regression model for improved patient outcome prediction, incorporating tumor stage, chromosome 17, and amplification/deletion status.

The goal is to develop a systematic way of placing patients with similar CGH imbalance profiles into the same cluster. Our expectation is that patients with the same cancer types will generally belong to the same cluster as their underlying CGH profiles will be similar. RESULTS: We focus on distance-based clustering strategies. We do this in two steps. (1) Distances of all pairs of CGH samples are computed. (2) CGH samples are clustered based on this distance. We develop three pairwise distance/similarity measures, namely raw, cosine and sim. Raw measure disregards correlation between contiguous genomic intervals. It compares the aberrations in each genomic interval separately. The remaining measures assume that consecutive genomic intervals may be correlated. Cosine maps pairs of CGH samples into vectors in a high-dimensional space and measures the angle between them. Sim measures the number of independent common aberrations. We test our distance/similarity measures on three well known clustering algorithms, bottom-up, top-down and k-means with and without centroid shrinking. Our results show that sim consistently performs better than the remaining measures. This indicates that the correlation of neighboring genomic intervals should be considered in the structural analysis of CGH datasets. The combination of sim with top-down clustering emerged as the best approach. AVAILABILITY: All software developed in this article and all the datasets are available from the authors upon request.

PROCEDURE: We used representational difference analysis to identify candidate E2A-HLF target genes. Transient transfection assays and an inducible expression model system were then used to evaluate the ability of E2A-HLF to modulate target gene expression. RESULTS: We identified ABCB1 (MDR1, P-glycoprotein) as a gene differentially expressed in ALL cell lines with and without E2A-HLF expression and demonstrated that t(17;19)+ ALL cell lines expressed high levels of ABCB1 protein and had a drug efflux-positive phenotype. Although ABCB1 transcription is regulated by C/EBPbeta via interaction with a DNA response element that shares significant homology with the optimal E2A-HLF binding site, E2A-HLF did not directly activate transcription of reporter genes under control of ABCB1 promoter elements in transient transfection assays. However, ABCB1 expression was induced in a DNA-binding independent manner by E2A-HLF, E2A-PBX1, and truncated E2A polypeptides consisting of those portions of E2A present in leukemic fusion proteins. CONCLUSIONS: E2A-HLF-mediated over-expression of ABCB1 may play a critical role in defining the clinical phenotype of ALLs with a t(17;19), suggesting pharmacologic modulation of ABCB1 activity as a rational therapeutic strategy for this chemotherapy resistant subtype of ALL.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2007-01-01-Genomic-imbalances/","title":"Genomic imbalances in 5918 malignant epithelial tumors: an explorative meta-analysis of chromosomal CGH data","text":""},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2007-01-01-Genomic-imbalances/#baudis-m","title":"Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract BACKGROUND: Chromosomal abnormalities have been associated with most human malignancies, with gains and losses on some genomic regions associated with particular entities.

Related average imbalance patterns were found for clinically distinct entities, e.g. hepatocellular carcinomas (ca.) and ductal breast ca., as well as for histologically related entities (squamous cell ca. of different sites).

However, diagnostic dilemmas may arise in daily practice due to overlap of BL with subsets of other aggressive, mature B-cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Recently, two gene expression studies have described a distinct molecular profile for BL, but also showed the persistence of some cases intermediate between BL and DLBCL. An alternative approach to define BL is to consider (cyto)genetic data, in particular chromosomal abnormalities other than the t(8;14) or its variants. In this review the 'Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer,' harboring the majority of all published neoplasia-related karyotypes, was explored to define a cytogenetic profile of 'true' BL. This core subset of BL showed a very low complexity of chromosomal abnormalities with 40% of the cases having the IG-MYC fusion as the sole abnormality. In the remaining cases, additional recurrent but partially exclusive abnormalities included gains at chromosomes 1q, 7 and 12, and losses of 6q, 13q32-34 and 17p. Within the core subset, no differences were found between pediatric and adult patients. In addition, the genetic profile of the core subset was significantly different from BL with an 8q24 breakpoint not affecting one of the three immunoglobulin loci, BL with a translocation involving 18q21/BCL2, 3q27/BCL6 or 11q13/BCL1, additionally to a breakpoint at 8q24/MYC, and from other morphological types of lymphomas with an 8q24/MYC breakpoint. These groups showed a higher cytogenetic complexity than the core subset of BL. BL without a detectable 8q24/MYC breakpoint might be heterogeneous and deserves further studies. We suggest that, concordant with the WHO classification to be published in 2008, the diagnosis of BL should be restricted to cases with expression of CD10 and BCL6, absence or very weak expression of BCL2 protein, a homogeneously very high proliferation index and a proven IG-MYC translocation without evidence of a chromosomal translocation typical for other lymphoma entities. In addition, a high number of nonspecific cytogenetic abnormalities should suggest need for a critical review of the diagnosis of BL.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-07-01-Recurrent-loss%2C-but/","title":"Recurrent loss, but...","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-07-01-Recurrent-loss%2C-but/#recurrent-loss-but-lack-of-mutations-of-the-smarcb1-tumor-suppressor-gene-in-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia-with-tcl1a-tcrad-juxtaposition","title":"Recurrent loss, but lack of mutations, of the SMARCB1 tumor suppressor gene in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia with TCL1A-TCRAD juxtaposition.","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-07-01-Recurrent-loss%2C-but/#bug-s-durig-j-oyen-f-klein-hitpass-l-martin-subero-ji-harder-l-baudis-m-arnold-n-kordes-u-duhrsen-u-schneppenheim-r-siebert-r","title":"Bug S, D\u00fcrig J, Oyen F, Klein-Hitpass L, Martin-Subero JI, Harder L, Baudis M, Arnold N, Kordes U, D\u00fchrsen U, Schneppenheim R, Siebert R.","text":"<p>Abstract In T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), chromosomal imbalances affecting the long arm of chromosome 22 are regarded as typical chromosomal aberrations secondary to a TCRAD-TCL1A fusion due to inv(14) or t(14;14).

RESULTS: This article develops an efficient method that can accurately model the progression of the cancer markers and reconstruct evolutionary relationship between multiple types of cancers using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data. Such modeling can lead to better understanding of the commonalities and differences between multiple cancer types and potential therapies. We have developed an automatic method to infer a graph model for the markers of multiple cancers from a large population of CGH data. Our method identifies highly related markers across different cancer types. It then builds a directed acyclic graph that shows the evolutionary history of these markers based on how common each marker is in different cancer types. We demonstrated the use of this model in determining the importance of markers in cancer evolution. We have also developed a new method to measure the evolutionary distance between different cancers based on their markers. This method employs the graph model we developed for the individual markers to measure the distance between pairs of cancers. We used this measure to create an evolutionary tree for multiple cancers.

Since duplication of the KCNQ1 gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the same channel was reported recently in another SRS patient, we screened both genes for mutations in a cohort of SRS patients without detecting pathologic variants. We presume that the duplication of the two functionally linked genes in different patients with the same disorder is a coincidental finding. However, the lack of DS typical clinical features in our case allows us to further narrow down the DSCR in 21q22.

Several studies have shown that MUC1 overexpression is due to transcriptional regulatory events. However, the importance of gene amplification as a mechanism leading to the increase of MUC1 expression in breast cancer has been poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of MUC1 gene amplification and protein expression in human breast cancer development. By means of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical methods, 83 breast tissue samples were analyzed for MUC1 gene amplification and protein expression. This analysis showed MUC1 genomic amplification and a positive association with the histopathological group in 12% (1 out of 8) of benign lesions and 38% (23 out of 60) of primary invasive breast carcinoma samples (P = 0.004). Array-comparative genomic hybridization meta-analysis of 886 primary invasive breast carcinomas obtained from 22 studies showed MUC1 genomic gain in 43.7% (387 out of 886) of the samples. Moreover, we identified a highly statistical significant association between MUC1 gene amplification and MUC1 protein expression assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot test (P &lt; 0.0001).

Since more than one CNA can be detected in most tumors, frequently co-occurring genetic CNA may point to cooperating cancer related genes. Existing methods for co-occurrence evaluation so far have not considered the overall heterogeneity of CNA per tumor, resulting in a preferential detection of frequent changes with limited specificity for each association due to the high genetic instability of many samples. METHOD: We hypothesize that in cancer some linkage-independent CNA may display a non-random co-occurrence, and that these CNA could be of pathogenetic relevance for the respective cancer. We also hypothesize that the statistical relevance of co-occurring CNA may depend on the sample specific CNA complexity. We verify our hypotheses with a simulation based algorithm CDCOCA (complexity dependence of co-occurring chromosomal aberrations). RESULTS: Application of CDCOCA to example data sets identified co-occurring CNA from low complex background which otherwise went unnoticed. Identification of cancer associated genes in these co-occurring changes can provide insights of cooperative genes involved in oncogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a method to detect associations of regional copy number abnormalities in cancer data. Along with finding statistically relevant CNA co-occurrences, our algorithm points towards a generally low specificity for co-occurrence of regional imbalances in CNA rich samples, which may have negative impact on pathway modeling approaches relying on frequent CNA events.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2011-07-01-Silver-Russell/","title":"Silver-Russell patients showing a broad range of ICR1 and ICR2 hypomethylation in different tissues","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2011-07-01-Silver-Russell/#begemann-m-spengler-s-kanber-d-haake-a-baudis-m-leisten-i-binder-g-markus-s-rupprecht-t-segerer-h-fricke-otto-s-muhlenberg-r-siebert-r-buiting-k-eggermann-t","title":"Begemann M, Spengler S, Kanber D, Haake A, Baudis M, Leisten I, Binder G, Markus S, Rupprecht T, Segerer H, Fricke-Otto S, M\u00fchlenberg R, Siebert R, Buiting K, Eggermann T.","text":"<p>Abstract In all known congenital imprinting disorders an association with aberrant methylation or mutations at specific loci was well established. However, several patients with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM), Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) exhibiting multilocus hypomethylation (MLH) have meanwhile been described. Whereas TNDM patients with MLH show clinical symptoms different from carriers with isolated 6q24 aberrations, MLH carriers diagnosed as BWS or SRS present only the syndrome-specific features. Interestingly, SRS and BWS patients with nearly identical MLH patterns in leukocytes have been identified. We now report on the molecular findings in DNA in three SRS patients with hypomethylation of both 11p15 imprinted control regions (ICRs) in leukocytes. One patient was a monozygotic (MZ) twin, another was a triplet. While the hypomethylation affected both oppositely imprinted 11p15 ICRs in leukocytes, in buccal swab DNA only the ICR1 hypomethylation was visible in two of our patients. In the non-affected MZ twin of one of these patients, aberrant methylation was also present in leukocytes but neither in buccal swab DNA nor in skin fibroblasts. Despite mutation screening of several factors involved in establishment and maintenance of methylation marks including ZFP57, MBD3, DNMT1 and DNMT3L the molecular clue for the ICR1/ICR2 hypomethylation in our patients remained unclear. Furthermore, the reason for the development of the specific SRS phenotype is not obvious. In conclusion, our data reflect the broad range of epimutations in SRS and illustrate that an extensive molecular and clinical characterization of patients is necessary.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-Integrative/","title":"Integrative genome-wide expression profiling identifies three distinct molecular subgroups of renal cell carcinoma with different patient outcome","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-Integrative/#beleut-m-zimmermann-p-baudis-m-bruni-n-buhlmann-p-laule-o-luu-vd-gruissem-w-schraml-p-moch-h","title":"Beleut M, Zimmermann P, Baudis M, Bruni N, B\u00fchlmann P, Laule O, Luu VD, Gruissem W, Schraml P, Moch H.","text":"<p>Abstract BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is characterized by a number of diverse molecular aberrations that differ among individuals. Recent approaches to molecularly classify RCC were based on clinical, pathological as well as on single molecular parameters. As a consequence, gene expression patterns reflecting the sum of genetic aberrations in individual tumors may not have been recognized. In an attempt to uncover such molecular features in RCC, we used a novel, unbiased and integrative approach. METHODS: We integrated gene expression data from 97 primary RCC of different pathologic parameters, 15 RCC metastases as well as 34 cancer cell lines for two-way nonsupervised hierarchical clustering using gene groups suggested by the PANTHER Classification System. We depicted the genomic landscape of the resulted tumor groups by means of Single Nuclear Polymorphism (SNP) technology. Finally, the achieved results were immunohistochemically analyzed using a tissue microarray (TMA) composed of 254 RCC. RESULTS: We found robust, genome wide expression signatures, which split RCC into three distinct molecular subgroups. These groups remained stable even if randomly selected gene sets were clustered. Notably, the pattern obtained from RCC cell lines was clearly distinguishable from that of primary tumors. SNP array analysis demonstrated differing frequencies of chromosomal copy number alterations among RCC subgroups. TMA analysis with group-specific markers showed a prognostic significance of the different groups.

Besides specifically targeting well-known, canonical oncogenes, CNAs may also play more subtle roles in terms of modulating genetic potential and broad gene expression patterns of developing tumors. Any significant differences in the overall CNA patterns between different cancer types may thus point towards specific biological mechanisms acting in those cancers. In addition, differences among CNA profiles may prove valuable for cancer classifications beyond existing annotation systems. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have analyzed molecular-cytogenetic data from 25579 tumors samples, which were classified into 160 cancer types according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system. When correcting for differences in the overall CNA frequencies between cancer types, related cancers were often found to cluster together according to similarities in their CNA profiles. Based on a randomization approach, distance measures from the cluster dendrograms were used to identify those specific genomic regions that contributed significantly to this signal. This approach identified 43 non-neutral genomic regions whose propensity for the occurrence of copy number alterations varied with the type of cancer at hand. Only a subset of these identified loci overlapped with previously implied, highly recurrent (hot-spot) cytogenetic imbalance regions. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, for many genomic regions, a simple null-hypothesis of independence between cancer type and relative copy number alteration frequency can be rejected. Since a subset of these regions display relatively low overall CNA frequencies, they may point towards second-tier genomic targets that are adaptively relevant but not necessarily essential for cancer development.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-arrayMap-a/","title":"arrayMap: a reference resource for genomic copy number imbalances in human malignancies","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-arrayMap-a/#cai-h-kumar-n-baudis-m","title":"Cai H, Kumar N, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract BACKGROUND: The delineation of genomic copy number abnormalities (CNAs) from cancer samples has been instrumental for identification of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes and proven useful for clinical marker detection.

One additional case study was identified from contact with experts. Individual patient data were extracted from publications or obtained from investigators, and CNAs were converted to a digitized format suitable for data mining and subgroup identification. Summary profiles for genomic imbalances were generated from case-specific data. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and by univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. In their overall CNA profiles, low grade tumors of the pineal region clearly diverged from CNS-PNET and pineoblastoma. At a median follow-up of 89 months, 7-year OS rates of CNS-PNET, pineoblastoma, and low grade tumors of the pineal region were 22.9 \u00b1 6, 0 \u00b1 0, and 87.5 \u00b1 12 %, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that histology (CNS-PNET), age (\u22642.5 years), and possibly recurrent CNAs were associated with unfavorable OS.

A recently redesigned multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay identifies PMS2 copy number alterations with improved reliability when used with reference DNAs containing equal numbers of PMS2- and PMS2CL-specific sequences. We selected eight such reference samples--all publicly available--and used them with this assay to study 13 patients with PMS2-defective colorectal tumors.

It is not clear in detail which signaling pathways or networks regulate the induction of either apoptosis or senescence. Primary human fibroblasts are able to withstand high doses of irradiation and to prevent irradiation-induced apoptosis. However, the underlying regulatory basis for this phenotype is not well understood. Here, a kinetic network analysis based on reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs) in combination with extensive western blot and cell culture analyses was employed to decipher the cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling networks and to identify possible antiapoptotic pathways. This analysis identified activation of known DNA damage response pathways (e.g., phosphorylation of MKK3/6, p38, MK2, Hsp27, p53 and Chk1) as well as of prosurvival (e.g., MEK-ERK, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), protein kinase C (PKC)) and antiapoptotic markers (e.g., Bad, Bcl-2). Interestingly, PKC family members were activated early upon irradiation, suggesting a regulatory function in the ionizing radiation (IR) response of these cells. Inhibition or downregulation of PKC in primary human fibroblasts caused IR-dependent downregulation of the identified prosurvival (CREB phosphorylation) and antiapoptotic (Bad phosphorylation, Bcl-2) markers and thus lead to a proliferation stop and to apoptosis. Taken together, our analysis suggests that cytoplasmic PKC signaling conditions IR-stressed MRC-5 and IMR-90 cells to prevent irradiation-induced apoptosis.

Here we describe the results of SIL1 mutation analysis in 62 patients presenting with early-onset ataxia, cataracts and myopathy or combinations of at least two of these. We obtained a mutation detection rate of 60% (15/25) among patients with the characteristic Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome triad (ataxia, cataracts, myopathy) whereas the detection rate in the group of patients with more variable phenotypic presentation was below 3% (1/37). We report 16 unrelated families with a total of 19 different SIL1 mutations. Among these mutations are 15 previously unreported changes, including single- and multi-exon deletions. Based on data from our screening cohort and data compiled from the literature we found that SIL1 mutations are invariably associated with the combination of a cerebellar syndrome and chronic myopathy. Cataracts were observed in all patients beyond the age of 7 years, but might be missing in infants. Six patients with SIL1 mutations had no intellectual disability, extending the known wide range of cognitive capabilities in Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome to include normal intelligence. Modestly constant features were somatic growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities and pyramidal tract signs. Examination of mutant SIL1 expression in cultured patient lymphoblasts suggested that SIL1 mutations result in severely reduced SIL1 protein levels irrespective of the type and position of mutations. Our data broaden the SIL1 mutation spectrum and confirm that SIL1 is the major Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome gene. SIL1 patients usually present with the characteristic triad but cataracts might be missing in young children. As cognitive impairment is not obligatory, patients without intellectual disability but a Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome-compatible phenotype should receive SIL1 mutation analysis. Despite allelic heterogeneity and many families with private mutations, the phenotype related to SIL1 mutations is relatively homogenous. Based on SIL1 expression studies we speculate that this may arise from a uniform effect of different mutations on protein expression.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Biopsying-parapsoria/","title":"Biopsying parapsoriasis: quo vadis?

It was first named by Brocq, in 1902, as an entity with three components: pityriasis lichenoides, small plaque parapsoriasis and large plaque parapsoriasis. Nowadays, under the name of parapsoriasis are included only the last two categories, that are considered disorders characterized by the presence of a mononuclear infiltrate in the dermis, composed of T-cells. Until now, there were not established pathognomonic histopathological features to diagnose parapsoriasis. AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the epidemiological and morphological data of parapsoriasis cases diagnosed at Emergency City Hospital, Timisoara, Romania for a period of 12 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study had two parts; one was retrospective and another one prospective. For the retrospective part, we searched 210111 patient files recorded in our Pathology Service for a period of 11 years, from January 2002 to December 2012. The slides were searched from the archive and re-read by two individual pathologists. For prospective part of the study, we reviewed 11815 histological slides read between January and June 2013. After inspection of the recorded files, the pathologists noted, were available, the localization and number of the lesions, together with symptoms. The biopsied specimens were initially processed with routine histological technique, the archive slides being stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. While reading the slides, the pathologists paid attention to the architecture of the epidermis, the presence of epidermotropism and interface dermatitis, type of the dermal infiltrate and its distributions. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we emphasized the histopathological aspects of parapsoriasis in order to create a basic line that could help in the establishment of a uniformly accepted definition of parapsoriasis on histopathological grounds.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Chromothripsis-like/","title":"Chromothripsis-like patterns are recurring but heterogeneously distributed features in a survey of 22,347 cancer genome screens","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Chromothripsis-like/#cai-h-kumar-n-bagheri-hc-von-mering-c-robinson-md-baudis-m","title":"Cai H, Kumar N, Bagheri HC, von Mering C, Robinson MD, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract BACKGROUND: Chromothripsis is a recently discovered phenomenon of genomic rearrangement, possibly arising during a single genome-shattering event. This could provide an alternative paradigm in cancer development, replacing the gradual accumulation of genomic changes with a \"one-off\" catastrophic event. However, the term has been used with varying operational definitions, with the minimal consensus being a large number of locally clustered copy number aberrations. The mechanisms underlying these chromothripsis-like patterns (CTLP) and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we identified CTLP in 918 cancer samples, from a dataset of more than 22,000 oncogenomic arrays covering 132 cancer types. Fragmentation hotspots were found to be located on chromosome 8, 11, 12 and 17. Among the various cancer types, soft-tissue tumors exhibited particularly high CTLP frequencies. Genomic context analysis revealed that CTLP rearrangements frequently occurred in genomes that additionally harbored multiple copy number aberrations (CNAs). An investigation into the affected chromosomal regions showed a large proportion of arm-level pulverization and telomere related events, which would be compatible to a number of underlying mechanisms. We also report evidence that these genomic events may be correlated with patient age, stage and survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: Through a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets, this study characterized features associated with genomic aberrations patterns, compatible to the spectrum of \"chromothripsis\"-definitions as previously used. While quantifying clustered genomic copy number aberrations in cancer samples, our data indicates an underlying biological heterogeneity behind these chromothripsis-like patterns, beyond a well defined \"chromthripsis\" phenomenon.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Progenetix-12-years/","title":"Progenetix: 12 years of oncogenomic data curation","text":""},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Progenetix-12-years/#cai-h-kumar-n-ai-n-gupta-s-rath-p-baudis-m","title":"Cai H, Kumar N, Ai N, Gupta S, Rath P, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) can be found in the majority of cancer genomes and are crucial for understanding the potential mechanisms underlying tumor initiation and progression.

As a consequence, the number of established cell lines used for experimental in vitro and in vivo osteosarcoma research is limited and the value of these cell lines relies on their stability during culture. Here we investigated the stability in gene expression by microarray analysis and array genomic hybridization of three low metastatic cell lines and derivatives thereof with increased metastatic potential using cells of different passages.The osteosarcoma cell lines showed altered gene expression during in vitro culture, and it was more pronounced in two metastatic cell lines compared to the respective parental cells. Chromosomal instability contributed in part to the altered gene expression in SAOS and LM5 cells with low and high metastatic potential. To identify metastasis-relevant genes in a background of passage-dependent altered gene expression, genes involved in \"Pathways in cancer\" that were consistently regulated under all passage comparisons were evaluated. Genes belonging to \"Hedgehog signaling pathway\" and \"Wnt signaling pathway\" were significantly up-regulated, and IHH, WNT10B and TCF7 were found up-regulated in all three metastatic compared to the parental cell lines.Considerable instability during culture in terms of gene expression and chromosomal aberrations was observed in osteosarcoma cell lines.
